/**
 * Installation-mode loop programs.
 *
 * The kiosk attract loop runs a series of PROGRAMS back to back, each
 * with the same theatrical format: intro screen ("Resonance presenting
 * …" + description) → journeys → ending dedication screen. After the
 * last program's dedication, the loop wraps to the first program.
 *
 * Program order (2026-08-24, per Karel): Welcome Home first, then the
 * Snowflake EP. More programs may be added later.
 *
 * Journeys resolve two ways:
 *   - `journeyIds`      — built-in journeys from journeys.ts
 *   - `pathShareToken`  — a journey_paths row (journey_ids in order,
 *                         then culmination last). Works online via
 *                         Supabase and offline via the Tramokyo pack.
