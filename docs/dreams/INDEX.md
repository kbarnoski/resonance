- **[/dream/248-kids-stir-garden](/dream/248-kids-stir-garden)** — Stir Garden 🌱. `demoable`
  **For kids 4+ — GROW a living, glowing garden by MOVING your whole body in front of the camera. No touching the screen, no reading, no wrong moves.** Where the child moves, coral/leopard-spot **Turing patterns** bloom in glowing teal→coral→gold and the garden gently sings. Built on a real **Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion** simulation running on the GPU via **raw WebGL2 ping-pong framebuffers** (render-to-texture, 6 sub-steps/frame, clamp-stabilized) — *not* a triggered animation but a living chemistry that keeps growing on its own. **Zero-dependency frame-differencing** (a hidden 64×48 offscreen canvas, no MediaPipe/ML) turns whole-body motion into a seed injected into the `v` chemical, mirrored so it feels like a mirror; 5 horizontal zones map to C-pentatonic notes (sine+triangle, gentle envelopes, feedback-delay shimmer, DynamicsCompressor limiter), an always-on pad swells with motion, and after 3s of stillness the garden auto-blooms so it never looks dead. **First reaction-diffusion / GPU-simulation piece in the kids zone, and the first raw-GLSL kids piece** — the ~115 prior kids builds are touch+2D-canvas or three.js. It introduces a different *temporality* of play (plant→bloom, not the lab's tap→chime reflex) and extends the just-loved no-touch-camera direction of `234-kids-hand-creature` ❤️ with a lighter, no-ML input. Camera-denied → pointer "stir" fallback (`text-rose-300` notice); no-WebGL2 → readable notice + pad keeps playing; video hidden + frames discarded each tick (privacy). References Amanda Ghassaei's Gray-Scott RD shader (+ directed-field variant), cake23.de Turing-fluid, Karl Sims' RD parameter map, Daniel Rozin motion mirrors; born from this cycle's research dive on interactive stir-able RD.

- **[/dream/246-spectral-splat](/dream/246-spectral-splat)** — Spectral Splat. `demoable`
  **Fly *through* your own music as a soft volumetric cloud of light.** Drop in a track (or use mic, or the built-in generative pad) and each FFT frame is deposited as a slab of soft, additive **Gaussian splats** — anisotropic glowing blobs with a true `exp(-r²)` falloff — into a ring buffer parked ahead of the camera; the camera then **dollies forward through** the accumulating nebula, so older frames recede into fog. Where `243-spectral-cloud` ❤️ has you *orbit* a hard point cloud, this one has you *travel into* a soft luminous volume with body — a continuous fog, not dots. Custom `ShaderMaterial` (additive, depth-write off, screen-X anisotropy), geometry allocated once / only typed-arrays rewritten per frame. Reactive: spectral **centroid** → hue drift + cloud dispersion; energy-flux **onset** → coloured shockwave shell + brightness bloom + forward speed surge; corner HUD shows source / BPM / onset. **First Gaussian-splat / soft-volumetric piece in the lab** — all prior volumetric work (`243` ❤️, `130-tsl-particle-compute` ❤️, `236`) renders hard additive points or particle sims. Born from this cycle's research dive on **AudioGS — "Spectrogram-Based Audio Gaussian Splatting"** (arxiv 2604.08967, Apr 2026); visual lineage Refik Anadol *Machine Hallucinations* + Ryoji Ikeda.

  **For kids 4+ — *sing* to grow and shape a glowing 3D creature that sings your melody back. No touching the screen, no reading, no wrong notes.** A luminous blob-creature floats in a soft bedtime sky; the child hums or sings into the mic and it breathes, **swells with loudness**, **changes hue with pitch** (low = deep violet → high = cyan/rose), **grows** the longer they sing, and — after a beat of quiet — **sings their little tune right back** as glowing pulses (call-and-response ear-training). Built on raw three.js: a high-res icosphere displaced along its normals by layered **GLSL simplex-noise in a custom `ShaderMaterial`**, fresnel rim + additive halo = glowing-jelly look. Mic = **autocorrelation pitch detection** (parabolic-interp + RMS gate), snapped to **C-major pentatonic** so anything sung sounds right; a soft sine tracks the snapped pitch so the child hears themselves in tune. Always-on ambient C/G drone + idle breathing (never silent/dead); mic is analyser-only, never recorded. **First voice→3D-morphing-creature in the lab** (the ~110 prior kids pieces are touch + 2D canvas; `158-kids-hum-paint` ❤️ is voice→2D paint; `234` is *hands*→3D). Mic-denied → 160px tap-and-hold fallback feeding pentatonic notes; WebGL-absent shows a notice. Winner of a WIDE 3-builder kids fire (siblings `kids-clap-dancers` onset→3D-band + `kids-body-band` camera-motion banked in IDEAS.md).

  **For kids 4+ — grow and play a glowing 3D creature with your hands, no touching the screen.** Hold your hands up in front of the iPad's front camera and *conduct* a blobby creature: **raise your hands** and it inflates, brightens, and rings soft pentatonic notes (C4→C5 by height); **open your hands wide** and it spikes and sparkles; **bring up a second hand** and a little satellite blob orbits the main one. Built on raw three.js — a high-detail icosahedron displaced in a **vertex shader** by 3D simplex noise (Ashima `snoise`), rim-lit jelly glow — driven live by **MediaPipe HandLandmarker** (21 keypoints/hand, GPU, CDN-loaded, never silent thanks to an always-on sine pad). **First MediaPipe prototype in the lab and first 3D/WebGL piece in the kids zone** — the entire kids zone before this was touch + canvas2d. Camera-denied or offline degrades to a self-playing pentatonic auto-demo + tap-to-bounce.

- **[/dream/233-earth-pulse](/dream/233-earth-pulse)** — Earth Pulse. `demoable`
  The **last 24 hours of global earthquakes, played as music.** Pulls the live USGS "all_day" GeoJSON feed (public, keyless, CORS-open) and turns every quake into a sounding event sequenced in compressed real time over a pulsing wireframe globe. **Magnitude → loudness + pitch** (bigger = deeper boom: M2≈170 Hz, M7≈30 Hz); **depth → timbre** (shallow = bright crack, deep = muffled rumble); **longitude → stereo pan**. A full day compresses into ~1.25–4 min (Slow/Normal/Fast); aftershock swarms become audible flurries. The globe (react-three-fiber: wireframe graticule + occluding core + a `Points` shader colored warm→violet by depth + Bloom) flares each quake as it sounds; drag to orbit. Synthetic fallback set if the feed is blocked. **First prototype in the lab to sonify a real external API** — the world writes the score; open it on different days and it's a different piece.

  **For kids 4+** — Five BANDIMAL xylophone bars sit at the bottom (C3/violet/tallest → C4/cyan/shortest). Coloured drops fall from above, one per column, with ~3–4s of fall time. **Tap a drop while it's falling** → loud bell note (triangle + ×2.756 partial) + 20-sparkle burst + bright bar flash. **Let it land** → quiet note + 10-sparkle splash. **Tap a bar directly** → note + sparkles, any time. Drops drift gently toward their column center as they fall — catch zone is predictable. Auto-spawn: 1 drop every 1.5s, 2 demo drops at load. Pentatonic C3–C4 only — no uncaught drop ever sounds wrong. **First kids prototype where the mechanic is catching a moving target** — 231 prior kids prototypes respond to WHERE you tap; this adds WHEN (timing + moving-target tracking). Three reward tiers (catch/land/bar-tap) are immediately perceptible without score counters. Zero permissions · Zero deps · 2.65 kB.

- **[/dream/231-mood-xy](/dream/231-mood-xy)** — Mood XY. `demoable`
  Drag a dot through the **Russell circumplex emotion plane** (X = valence: sad ← → happy; Y = arousal: calm ↓ → excited). The Web Audio synthesizer follows in real time: arousal drives BPM (40–140), voice count (1–6), attack shape (pad → staccato), and oscillator type (sine → triangle); valence drives chord quality (major / minor / diminished), filter cutoff (warm → bright), and note duration (long → short). At **excited · happy**: bright major arpeggios, 6 voices, 45ms stagger, 120+ BPM. At **calm · sad**: sparse diminished chords, 1 voice, long sustain, 40 BPM. Background color bilinearly interpolates between 4 dark quadrant tones (deep amber / deep purple / deep teal / deep navy). Beat-synced glow pulse on the dot breathes with BPM. Trail of 72 fading circles follows movement. **First prototype where you set emotional intent and music follows.** Zero deps · Zero permissions · 2.81 kB.

- **[/dream/230-kids-bubble-duet](/dream/230-kids-bubble-duet)** — Bubble Duet. `demoable`
  **For kids 3+** — Two soap bubbles float on a starry canvas: **YOU** (pink, smiley face) and **FRIEND** (cyan, ♪). Tap the pink bubble to play a random pentatonic note and bounce it; 1.2 seconds later FRIEND brightens, bounces, and plays a **consonant response** (C3→G3 P5, E3→A3 P4, G3→C4 P4, A3→C3 octave, C4→G3 P4). During the exchange, 16 cyan sparkles arc from FRIEND toward YOU and a dashed quadratic arc connects the two bubbles as a "conversation thread." After FRIEND sings: "your turn ♪" appears and the cycle repeats. **First kids prototype where the responder has a distinct character identity** — prior call-and-response prototypes (echo-drum, echo-canon) use a generic system; here FRIEND has a face, a color, and a musical voice.

- **[/dream/228-kids-creature-grow](/dream/228-kids-creature-grow)** — Creature Grow. `demoable`
  **For kids 4+** — A glowing creature hatches from an egg and grows as you feed it pentatonic notes. Each of the six taps permanently adds a new body part: **eyes** (cyan, C4) → **ears** (emerald, D4) → **smile** (amber, E4) → **arms** (blue, G4) → **legs** (rose, A4) → **wings** (gold, C5). Tap 6 = fully grown: 60-sparkle burst + "✨ Fully grown! ✨" + creature sings all six notes back with each body part glowing on its note. Tap again any time to sing again. **First kids prototype where tapping literally grows anatomy** — unlike face-song (pre-drawn face you toggle) or voice-monster (mic/blob), this starts from nothing: the body only exists because you tapped.

  Upload any audio file (WAV, MP3, or the built-in C major demo) and reshape it into a grain cloud. Four parameters: **scrub** position (which moment in the file), **grain size** (20–500 ms), **density** (2–30 grains/sec), **pitch shift** (±12 semitones), **scatter** (how far grains stray from the scrub point). Each grain is Hann-windowed, randomly panned, and given an attack+decay envelope; the result ranges from smooth frozen-chord textures to glitchy percussive clouds. Waveform strip shows the buffer; sparkle particles burst from the scrub cursor on every grain. **First granular synthesis prototype** — try Karel's Welcome Home recordings for instant time-stretching of real piano textures.

  A glowing face made of five musical parts. Tap each to wake it up: **head** (violet circle) = deep C2 drone; **left eye** (teal) = G3 pluck every 800ms + gentle blink; **right eye** (amber) = E3 pluck every 1200ms (polyrhythm offset); **nose** (rose) = A3 bounce every 600ms; **mouth** (cyan arc) = C3–G3–A3–E3–C4 melody (500ms/note), arc opens/closes while singing. Tap again to silence any part. When all five are active → sparkle burst + "La la la! ✨" flashes.

  Play a phrase on your piano — pause 2 seconds — Aria responds with a phrase generated from a
  Markov chain trained on YOUR intervals, then listens again. Split piano roll: YOU (orange, top)
  / ARIA (blue, bottom). **First dialogue prototype**: all 224 prior prototypes react continuously;
  this one waits for a complete musical thought before answering. The Markov table accumulates
  across exchanges — by the 4th–5th dialogue, Aria starts echoing Karel's own melodic habits.
  Piano timbre: 4 additive triangle partials with slight inharmonicity (4.05× partial). Demo mode

  Tap to plant a glowing flower — it grows over 1.4s (stem rises, 6 petals unfurl) and sustains
  its pentatonic note. BANDIMAL sizing: violet C3 (biggest, r=52) → rose C4 (smallest, r=24).
  **Plant two flowers within 34% of screen width**: a pulsing white arc connects their heads,
  both glow brighter, and a resonance chord rings out (both pitches + perfect fifth above the lower).
  **First prototype where spatial placement IS the harmonic composition** — WHERE you plant
  determines which chords form. Prior proximity prototypes (color-mix, bubble-bath) are transient;
  flowers stay put. First tap retroactively wakes all demo flowers with audio + chime. Tap a flower
  to remove it and break its resonance pairs.

  Draw any closed shape → Discrete Fourier Transform decomposes it into N rotating epicycles →
  the chain of spinning arms traces your shape while additive synthesis sounds each harmonic.
  The *shape of the drawing* IS the *timbre of the tone*: a circle → pure 55 Hz sine; a square →
  odd harmonics (sounds like a square wave); a 5-pointed star → fundamental + 5th harmonic; an
  asymmetric scribble → complex buzzy texture. Terms slider (1–64) lets you hear the Fourier series
  build from one pure oscillator to 64 harmonics — simultaneously a math lesson and a timbre sculptor.

  Tap anywhere to drop a glowing star magnet. Six pentatonic note-bubbles (BANDIMAL: bigger=lower,
  violet C3 → rose E4) float on a dark star-field and are pulled toward the nearest magnet by spring
  physics. Each bubble spirals in, rings its note at 52px distance, bounces outward, drifts back in
  — creating periodic, naturally-paced pentatonic melody from orbital dynamics. Multiple magnets (up to 4)
  produce layered polyrhythm without a clock. Two magnets auto-appear at load. AudioContext created on
  first tap. **First prototype where magnet placement geometry determines the melody** — not direct
  tapping but "composing forces." First orbital-physics sound generator in the dream zone.

  Move in front of the camera — the motion IS the music. Frame-differencing on a 20×15 grid yields
  three aggregate signals: totalMag (motion speed) → filter cutoff + arpeggiation rate;
  hBias (rightward vs. leftward flow) → pitch snapped to C major pentatonic; vBias (downward flow)
  → reverb depth. Arrow overlay shows each cell's flow vector, colored by direction (amber=right,
  violet=left, teal=up, rose=down). Demo mode: three glowing blobs bounce around a dark canvas
  generating flow without any camera permission needed. **First prototype where motion — not
  audio — is the primary musical input.** Different from `110-webcam-compose` (color → music):
  here stillness = silence, only movement makes sound. Inspired by Karel's love of

  Draw a waveform on a canvas — hear its timbre live via `createPeriodicWave`. Drag finger or mouse
  across the top 62% of the screen to reshape the oscillator's period; the timbre updates in real time
  as you draw. An amber overlay shows the actual oscillator output from `AnalyserNode`; a 32-bar harmonic
  chart below shows the Fourier spectrum of what you drew. Presets: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth.
  Pitch slider (A1–A5), volume slider. **First prototype where you draw a waveform shape and hear it as
  audio timbre** — the paradigm inversion of every other prototype (which convert audio → visual). All
  218 prior prototypes use FFT for analysis; this is the first that uses DFT for synthesis. The harmonic
  chart shows why a square wave sounds buzzy (odd harmonics only), why a sine is clean (harmonic 1 only),
  and why a jagged drawn curve sounds metallic (many harmonics populated). Inspired by Karel's love of

  A 12-joint spring-physics skeleton that dances to audio — head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips,
  knees, feet. Each body part is driven by its own frequency band: sub-bass bounces hips/feet, bass
  lifts shoulders, low-mid sways the torso left-right, mid swings arms counter-phase, high-mid flutters
  the wrists, treble nods the head. Spring physics (K=140, D=10) gives body-like movement — joints
  overshoot, oscillate, and settle as real limbs do. Demo mode: 6 incommensurable LFOs produce continuous
  fluid motion from the moment the page opens. Mic mode: skeleton mirrors whatever is playing in real time.
  **First prototype with an animated human skeleton.** 216 prior prototypes visualize audio as particles,
  fluid, terrain, rings, or canvas marks; this is the first where the visualization IS a human figure.

  Shimmer (rose). Tap any circle to add its instrument voice to a phase-locked band at 80 BPM. Tap again
  to remove it. All five loops share a common beat clock; a new voice always enters on-beat. BANDIMAL sizing:
  bigger circle = lower pitch (Bass r=76, Shimmer r=30). When all five are on: "✨ Full Band! ✨" flash +
  sparkle burst from all circles. Thin colored lines connect active circles (visual "playing together" metaphor).

  (A3/amber), left foot (C3/violet), right foot (E3/teal). Connected by a skeleton of dim white lines.
  Tap any body part → bell tone + spring bounce + sparkle burst. BANDIMAL sizing: feet are largest (C3/E3
  = deepest), head is smallest (C4 = highest) — a child discovers pitch-by-size intuitively in 2 taps.
  Cute face (two eyes + smile) drawn inside the head circle. Idle breathing animation (unique phase per
  part, slow sine pulse) makes the body feel alive before any touch. Visual-only demo cycles DEMO_SEQ

  Four BANDIMAL drum pads fill the screen. Tap any rhythm; after 1.5 seconds of silence the drum
  echoes it back exactly — cool-cyan overlay marks the drum's voice vs. the child's warm hues.
  Then one final +1 beat fires at the average inter-tap interval on the most-used pad, with a
  24-sparkle gold burst. Phase indicator at canvas center: pulsing red dot = recording; colored
  tap-count dots orbit during recording (one per tap in the pad's hue); pulsing cyan dot = echoing.
  **First rhythmic call-and-response prototype** — echoes exact timing (not pitch, not Markov),
  pure affirmation: whatever you tap is perfectly mirrored back plus one more.

  Play a melody into the mic; every note is instantly joined by its diatonic third and fifth —
  scale-correct companion voices that adapt as the key is detected. Three-lane scrolling piano roll:
  THIRD (light blue, top), YOU (warm orange, middle), FIFTH (deep blue, bottom). Key detection via
  Krumhansl-Kessler tonal hierarchy profiles (12-bin chroma × 24 major/minor templates, dot-product
  scoring). Diatonic intervals computed per scale degree — B in C major gets a minor third (D) and
  diminished fifth (F), not a fixed +4/+7 offset. Demo: ascending + descending C major scale.

  Tap to release glowing fireflies on a dark canvas. When two drift within 155 px they spin
  a vibrating silk thread — and a pentatonic chime fires, pitched by thread length (short = high,
  long = low). All threads harmonize. Up to 8 fireflies, 28 simultaneous threads. Fireflies drift

  Four large colored drum pads fill the screen. Tap any pad for an instant percussive sound
  + ripple ring: kick (violet, top-left, biggest), hi-hat (amber, top-right, smallest), snare
  (rose, bottom-left), tom (teal, bottom-right). BANDIMAL rule: bigger = lower pitch.
  After 2+ taps and 1.5s of silence, a **1st-order Markov chain** generates an 8-step drum
  response (8th notes at 80 BPM = 3s). The drum pads flash in sequence as the response plays.
  Transition matrix builds from the user's own tap sequence — the drum gradually mirrors
  which pads you tend to chain together. Tapping during response interrupts and rebuilds.
  Auto-demo plays a kick-hat-snare-hat pattern after 2.2s to show the interaction model.
  Drum sounds: kick (sine 110→40 Hz glide), hihat (noise → highpass 7500 Hz), snare
  (bandpass noise 1800 Hz + 185 Hz transient), tom (sine 155→75 Hz glide). Zero deps.

  Four concentric draggable rings sculpt a harmonic bell tone in real time. Outer (violet) = pitch
  (C2 → A5 via exponential mapping); Ring 2 (teal) = partial count (1 pure sine → 16 rich stack);
  Ring 3 (amber) = inharmonicity stretch (0% perfect harmonics → 22% metallic spread, via
  `f_n = f₀ × n × (1 + ih × (n-1))`); Inner (rose) = decay (0.15s sharp click → 5.0s slow gong).
  A quiet 16-partial drone plays continuously so parameter changes are heard instantly. Tap the
  center ▶ circle to fire a loud bell strike at the current timbre — decays with the Decay ring.
  Center shows a live circular waveform from the AnalyserNode (summed partials, 256 sample path).
  HUD row shows live values: note name + Hz, partial count, inharmonicity %, decay seconds.

  First tap wakes all four simultaneously; subsequent taps toggle individual circles on/off.
  BANDIMAL: biggest violet circle (76px) = deep C3 fundamental; smallest amber (38px) = bright C5.
  Triangle oscillators with 1/n gain rolloff; `setTargetAtTime` for click-free transitions.

  Audio-reactive stone cave rendered via SDF ray-marching in a WebGL fragment shader.
  The viewer is positioned **inside** the cave — stalactite columns, a torus arch, and rough stone
  walls surround them on all sides. Three audio axes: **bass** drives the `smin` blend factor `k`
  (cave walls organically melt together and pull apart), **treble** adds Perlin-noise surface
  displacement (smooth stone → rough/jagged), **spectral centroid** shifts the cave light color
  (warm violet-amber at low register, ice-blue at high). Onset transients shake the camera.
  Slow orbital drift: camera pendulums gently left-right while the cave's domain-repeated
  geometry tiles seamlessly along Z. **First prototype where the viewer is inside the visual
  space** — 205 prior prototypes render visuals on a surface; this renders a 3D room around you.

  Tap to blow a soap bubble — bubbles drift upward, when two touch they chime a harmony chord.
  Pitch by X zone (left=C3/violet → right=C4/cyan, pentatonic). BANDIMAL sizing (bigger=lower).
  Collision tracked via `colPairs` Set: chord fires once per collision onset (re-fires on
  re-contact). Soap bubble visual: translucent fill, colored rim with outer glow, inner
  iridescent ring (hue+40°), two radial-gradient highlights (top-left crescent + bottom glint).
  Gentle wobble (radius ±2.5 px, unique phase). Pop at top: bell pair + 12-sparkle burst.

  along CatmullRomCurve3 paths), each with its own wave phase (golden-ratio-ish offsets). Bass
  drives slow radial sway; mid drives lateral shimmer; treble makes the tips flicker fast. Onsets
  pulse the form outward. Color: deep cyan at tentacle bases → violet at tips. Bloom
  (intensity 1.9) makes the tips glow against the near-black ocean backdrop. Single `useFrame`

  Tap the dark starry sky to release a glowing paper lantern. Each lantern drifts upward with a
  gentle sinusoidal sway (10px peak, unique phase per lantern). When it floats off the top of the
  screen it plays a bright bell chime and scatters 14 sparkles. Pitch is determined by horizontal
  tap position: left = C3 (violet), stepping through E3/G3/A3, right = C4 (cyan) — pentatonic, no
  wrong notes. Up to 8 lanterns coexist; two demo lanterns auto-spawn so the canvas is alive before
  first touch. Launch tone: quiet triangle (0.14 gain, 0.85s). Exit chime: triangle fundamental +
  octave partial (0.30/0.08 gain, 1.8s) — noticeably brighter than launch, rewards patience.

  A circular drumhead solved with the 2D wave equation on a 64×64 grid.
  Tap anywhere inside the drum to excite a Gaussian displacement — the wave propagates
  outward from the strike point, reflects off the fixed circular rim, and creates standing
  wave patterns visible as a live blue/amber color map. Modal synthesis fires 6 oscillators
  at Bessel zero ratios (1.000 × 1.593 × 2.136 × 2.295 × 2.917 × 3.598) — the inharmonic
  overtones of a real circular membrane emerge from the physics, not from presets. Off-centre
  strikes emphasise asymmetric modes; centre strikes boost the symmetric (breathing) modes.
  Tension slider controls wave speed + fundamental (55–143 Hz). Damping controls decay time.

  Each of the 5 body segments = one pentatonic note: head = C4 (small/bright, BANDIMAL high),
  tail = C3 (large/deep, BANDIMAL low). Colors: head=cyan, segments descend through violet → teal
  → amber → rose. Three worms are spatially panned: left (−0.52), center, right (+0.52) — three
  simultaneous taps produce a stereo chord. After first tap: each worm's head auto-beats C4 at its
  own interval (2.1 / 2.4 / 2.9 s) for ambient polyrhythm. Tap tolerance 50 CSS px — generous for

  flies upward with sinusoidal drift, magnetically attracted to the nearest lamp. When it arrives:
  sparkle burst + bell chime (triangle + 2nd harmonic + reverb). Demo bugs auto-emerge from the

- **[/dream/187-shepard-tone](/dream/187-shepard-tone)** — Shepard Tone. `demoable`
  The auditory illusion of the infinite staircase. Eight sine-wave oscillators (A1–A8, one
  octave apart) all rise in pitch simultaneously, weighted by a bell curve so only the middle
  range is audible. When any oscillator exits the top of the audible range, it's already inaudible
  (bell weight ≈ 0), so the wrap-back to A1 is imperceptible — the pitch ascends forever.
  **Left column**: 8 glowing circles, each sized by its current bell weight — a wave of brightness
  sweeps upward continuously. **Right dial**: a clockface needle sweeps clockwise; one full rotation
  = one octave traversal (15s at default speed), its circular geometry mirroring the circular
  nature of the illusion. Controls: Rising/Falling toggle, Slow→Fast slider, Freeze (stops
  phase mid-spiral), Mic mode (amplitude → rate modulation). "What you hear is not what is
  physically happening" — the most fundamental demonstration of constructive pitch perception.
  **First psychoacoustics prototype in the sandbox.** 186 prior prototypes visualize audio.
  This one reveals that your brain is actively constructing pitch from physical signals, and
  that construction can be deliberately tricked.

  A breathing flower with five glowing petals — one per note of the C-major pentatonic scale
  (C3 / E3 / G3 / A3 / C4). Each petal expands and contracts on a 9-second cosine breath
  cycle, staggered so they ripple around the center in a continuous wave — **the flower is
  alive before the first tap**. Tap any petal: sparkle burst + note pulses louder. Tap empty
  canvas: all five petals bloom at once. Audio: triangle-wave oscillators with 3.5s
  impulse-response reverb; per-petal gain follows its breath phase smoothly.
  **"First kids prototype that breathes before any interaction."** 185 prior prototypes are
  static until touch. Breath Bloom is already animated on route load. Also the first with a
  cosine ease-in/ease-out breath curve — the petals accelerate through the midpoint and
  decelerate at the extremes, like real breathing.

  progression) → 12-bin **chroma extraction** → **chord detection** (24 major/minor templates,
  dot-product correlation) → scrolling **chord timeline** (right-to-left, block width = duration
  held, hue = root pitch class). Below the timeline: a live **chromagram** (12 vertical bars,
  root highlighted). Every 8 seconds: **section classifier** labels the current window as Intro /
  Build / Climax / Resolution / Coda based on onset density, chord-change rate, and spectral
  centroid. Three gauges (Density, Chord rate, Register) update in real time. Ghost section label
  floats in the canvas background. Demo: triangle-wave ii–V–I–IV in C, self-analyzed.
  First prototype to surface **musical structure** rather than signal — 184 prior prototypes

  Six glowing horizontal strings on a dark canvas: C5/A4/G4/E4/D4/C4 (top→bottom, BANDIMAL rule).
  Tap to drop a colored ball — it falls through the strings, each one plucking a **Karplus-Strong**
  note as the ball passes. **Pass-through physics**: strings absorb 38% kinetic energy per crossing
  (vy × 0.62) without reversing direction, so a ball traverses all 6 strings top-to-bottom then
  bounces off the floor and returns bottom-to-top — a descending then ascending pentatonic scale
  from a single tap. Each string glows and visually vibrates (fundamental mode shape) on contact;
  sparks burst at the collision point. Up to 8 balls fall simultaneously.
  **"A mallet falling through a harp."** Key difference from `109-kids-bounce-notes` (wall bounce,
  1D): here strings are permeable energy-absorbers, and the entire pitch range is traversed per ball.
  2 demo balls auto-spawn (no permissions needed). Ambient C2 + G2 pad from first tap.

  Watch a piano being played — two cartoon hands (violet left / rose right) float above a
  61-key keyboard (C2–C7) and spring-animate to each key as music sounds. **Bass register
  (below C4)** drives the left hand; **treble (C4–C7)** drives the right. Active keys
  glow violet when pressed. Three modes: **Bach demo** (Invention No. 1 fragment, all notes
  pre-scheduled, both voices visible); **mic** (play live — hands follow in real time via
  FFT peak detection per register); **recording** (paste a Resonance recording UUID →
  `/api/audio/[id]` → animated playback).
  Spring physics: k=0.12, damping=0.60 — fast enough to track melodies, smooth enough to
  look like a real hand sliding rather than teleporting. First prototype visualizing the ACT
  of playing rather than the sound of it. Implements AGENT.md directive: "use his real piano

  Six glowing crystal formations rise from a dark cave floor. **Taller crystal = lower pitch**
  (BANDIMAL rule). **Tap** to ring; **hold** to sustain a glass-bell note (3 sine partials:
  fundamental + octave + 2-octave, 2.2s decay on release). **Hold 4+ crystals together** → a
  resonance flash lights the whole cave. Crystals shimmer autonomously before first touch — the
  cave is alive from the moment the page loads. Ambient C2 drone from first tap.
  **"First kids prototype with sustained tones and glass bell timbre."** 181 prior prototypes
  play on tap-down; this sustains while held. Completely distinct from KS pluck (marble-run,
  pluck-field), triangle wave, or pure sine — the additive partials give a crystalline, slightly
  metallic ring. New dimension: a child discovers that holding longer = longer note (duration as
  a musical parameter). Four-crystal resonance rewards full-hand engagement.

  (820Hz bandpass Q=18, 820ms bell ring) · 💧 **Water** (noise sweeping 900→180Hz over 320ms)
  · 🥁 **Earth** (72Hz sub-kick, 440ms decay) · 🫙 **Glass** (2440Hz sharp ping, 86ms).
  **Tap** any zone for a hit. **Hold** for a 12.5Hz rapid-fire roll. **Two fingers** → louder
  accent + zone-color full-screen flash. Visual textures visible before first tap: wavy wood
  grain, diagonal metal hatch, animated water waves, stippled earth dots, sparkle glass crosses.
  **"The first kids prototype about timbre, not pitch."** All 180 prior prototypes use C-major
  pentatonic — the musical dimension is always high vs. low. Texture Drum asks: what does
  material sound like? A 3yo comparing Wood and Glass discovers instrumental timbre without

  at least one live cell. **Gliders** trace rising 4-note melodies that walk right and vanish.
  **Pulsars** (period-3 oscillators) produce repeating 2-bar loops. **R-pentomino** evolves

  generations, melodically unpredictable throughout. **Random 20%** self-organizes from dense
  noise into rhythmic clusters over tens of seconds.
  Click/drag the canvas to draw or erase cells. BPM slider (40–120) controls tick rate.
  **"What if generative music was also life?"** — first sandbox prototype where the musical
  structure is not reactive (every frame) or API-generated (one-shot) but self-organizing:

  A glowing blob-monster on a dark starry canvas. **Hum or sing** into the mic — the monster
  grows with your amplitude and its color shifts with pitch (low=violet, mid=teal, high=rose).
  A hunger bar fills as you sing. After **30 accumulated seconds** of voice, the monster bounces
  excitedly then **sings back a melody** from the distinct pitches it detected (up to 8 notes,
  in order-of-first-detection, 0.56s per note). Tap the monster for a surprised boop + eye-wobble.
  After 5s silence, eyes drift in a Lissajous wander. Demo mode (no mic) runs a LFO simulation.
  **"Feed me with your voice — I'll sing back what I heard."**
  First kids prototype with a character that accumulates a memory of the child's singing.

  500 luminous oriented ellipses arranged in a **Gaussian cloud** around the canvas centre
  (σ = 22% of canvas), rendered with `globalCompositeOperation = "screen"` — overlapping
  splats add light, never occlude. The dense centre always blooms to near-white; sparse edges
  show individual coloured splats clearly. Star-cluster quality without explicit brightness control.
  **Bass** → nearest 100 splats bloom outward (scale ×1.6 at full bass, fade slightly).
  **Treble** → all 500 splats slowly rotate (field swirls at high treble).
  **Spectral centroid** → global hue target shifts violet (265°) ↔ amber (35°) at 1°/splat/frame.
  **Onset** → 50 random splats scatter with a velocity impulse; spring back (k = 0.015) over ~2 s.
  Demo mode: three LFOs. Mic mode: live FFT via `useMicAnalyser`.
  **"A painting that breathes."** Qualitatively different from particles (discrete) and fluid

  white cursor sweeps left to right and plays every lit block, looping endlessly. **Drag** to paint
  a run of notes. **−/+** buttons adjust BPM (40–160). **✕ Clear** to start fresh.
  Visual: lego-brick blocks (rounded rect + plastic sheen + center stud) with bounce-and-glow

  **"Place bricks to build a melody."** First 2D pitch×time grid in the kids zone — all prior

  sandbox prototype where the viewer is *inside* the visual space. Camera orbits slowly inside
  the chamber looking toward centre. **Bass** drives the `smin` blend factor (0.05→0.68): stalactites
  and walls melt together on heavy bass, crystallise on silence. **Treble** roughens the stone
  surface via value-noise displacement. **Spectral centroid** shifts the cave glow from deep
  violet (bass-heavy) to ice blue (treble-heavy). **Onset** shakes the camera and pulses the
  surfaces white. Demo mode: three slow LFOs simulate a breathing cave with no audio output.
  Mic mode: live 6-band FFT drives all parameters via `useMicAnalyser`.
  **"You are inside a space that breathes with your music."** Completely new visual paradigm —

  Sing or hum a note — three harmony voices materialise around you in 3D space via HRTF
  spatialization: a **major third** (violet, upper-left, azimuth −45°), a **perfect fifth**
  (teal, upper-right, azimuth +45°), and a **bass octave** (rose, below, elevation −20°).
  All three follow every pitch change with 50ms portamento — smooth glides as you move
  between notes. Canvas: four glowing orbs in a choir formation, orb radius breathing with
  amplitude. A live note-name label ("C3", "G♯4") tracks the detected pitch.
  **"You sing one voice. Three more appear."** All 174 prior prototypes are either reactive
  (audio → visuals) or generative (API → audio). Vocal Choir does both: your voice is the
  input, and the output wraps spatially back around you. First choir prototype in the sandbox.

  3-5 glowing teardrops scatter and fall with gravity + gentle sine drift. **Hold a cloud** →
  continuous rain (one drop per 200ms). When a drop lands on the water surface below, it rings
  a bell note and leaves an expanding ripple. Auto-rain cycles through all three clouds every
  second so the canvas is never silent. C3+G3+C4 form a C major arpeggio — any combination of
  clouds sounds consonant.
  **"The note plays when the drop lands, not when you tap."** Same delay-as-pedagogy principle
  as `133-kids-ripple-pond` ❤️ (two waves meet → chord) and `171-kids-snow-globe` (snowflake

  4-slot phase-locked loop station — pure Web Audio API. **Load demo** synthesizes four loops
  offline (sub-bass drone, pentatonic melody, high arpeggio, rhythm pattern) and starts them
  all on the same beat grid with no permissions needed. **Tap REC** on any slot to record from
  mic; the loop closes on the next tap and snaps to the beat-1 boundary — a 1-bar loop and a
  2-bar loop automatically stay in rhythmic alignment. Per-slot bar-length picker (1/2/4 bars),
  MUTE (crossfade to zero), ✕ (clear). Waveform canvas per slot shows the recorded buffer as
  amplitude bars with a sweeping playhead while looping. TAP TEMPO sets BPM from median
  inter-tap interval. **"Build a multi-layer performance in real time."**
  This is the first sandbox prototype about *constructing* a composition — not reacting to audio,

  Tap anywhere on a dark night sky — a burst of 5–8 glowing snowflakes scatter from the touch
  point and drift down with gentle sinusoidal wobble. **The note plays when the flake lands**, not
  when you tap: a triangle-wave bell chime rings on touchdown, colored sparks burst at the landing
  point. **Tap high on the screen → high note** (rose = C4); **tap low → low note** (violet = C3).
  Five pitches across C-major pentatonic. Hold a finger for continuous snowfall ("blizzard mode").
  Demo mode auto-rains from center-height for 3.5 s on first open — shows the mechanic before any
  touch. 60 golden-ratio stars twinkle in the deep navy background. Faint snow glow at the ground.
  Soft C3+E3+G3 ambient pad throughout.
  **"First kids prototype where LANDING is the musical event — not the tap."**
  170 prior kids prototypes play a note on gesture (tap-down, drag, hold). Snow Globe plays when
  physics resolves: the child taps, watches the flake fall, then hears the ground ring. Cause and
  effect are separated by ~0.5–1.4 s of gravity — the same delay-as-pedagogy principle that makes
  `133-kids-ripple-pond` ❤️ so effective (two ripples meet → chord). The "high up = high note"

  Drag the morph slider to blend the harmonic spectrum between two waveforms. 40 sine
  partials (harmonics of C3) are amplitude-interpolated independently — at 50% you hear

  Sawtooth / Triangle / Square / Sine for both A and B — mix any two.
  **"The first sandbox prototype to synthesize audio from spectral manipulation, not just

  Ramp color encodes pitch: **high ramp = high note** (rose=E4 top, violet=C3 bottom),
  the same physical analogy as string length on a real instrument — a child discovers it
  without needing any explanation. Three demo ramps are pre-loaded so the canvas plays
  immediately. Marbles auto-launch every 4 seconds (up to 6 live); tap **Drop 🎵** for
  instant addition. Draw new ramps with a finger drag (>30px). **Clear** resets to the
  demo layout.
  **"First kids prototype where the child builds the machine before the music plays."**
  All 168 prior kids prototypes are reactive (tap/drag → immediate note). Marble Music

  Play piano into your mic — each note appears as a glowing colored bar scrolling left.
  Pitch sets the vertical row (C2 bottom to C6 top, 48 semitones); color shifts from
  violet (low) to red (high), matching the `1-live` band palette. Black-key rows are
  slightly darker, giving a familiar keyboard reference without being distracting.
  The "now" cursor sits near the right edge; the currently-detected note shows a live
  tail extending to it — you see the pitch in real time, not just after it ends.
  Note name (e.g. "F♯4") updates in the status bar while held.
  **Demo mode** plays a 26-note C major passage; notes scroll in from the right like a
  player-piano roll. **BPM slider** adjusts scroll speed (30–200).
  **"First notation-style prototype in the sandbox."** All 167 prior prototypes visualize
  audio as abstract art (fluid, particles, terrain) or physics (pendulums, ripples).
  Piano Roll renders recognizable musical information — a pianist sees their phrases as

- **[/dream/167-aria-companion](/dream/167-aria-companion)** — Aria. `demoable`
  Play piano into your mic. After two seconds of silence, Aria responds — a phrase
  built by walking a Markov bigram of your own note transitions. The table grows
  across the session: by the 5th call-and-response, Aria sounds like she's been
  listening carefully. Two-panel scrolling piano roll: YOU (warm orange bars) on
  top, ARIA (cool blue bars) below, both scrolling at 80px/s with a live-tail
  for the currently-detected note. Demo button (no mic): plays a C-pentatonic
  phrase and fires the first response in ~5s.
  **"The piano responds when you rest."** 166 prior prototypes are reactive (every
  frame) or generative (one-shot API call). Aria is the first **dialogue** prototype:
  listens, waits, then composes a response from what it heard. Zero ML inference,
  zero API, zero deps — the Markov chain is ~25 lines of JS.

- **[/dream/166-kids-lantern](/dream/166-kids-lantern)** — Night Garden (kids). `demoable`
  A near-black canvas hides 16 pentatonic stars — each one holds a note. Hold your finger
  anywhere and a warm amber lantern follows: stars within the radius glow and play their pitch
  (triangle waves, C-major pentatonic C3–A4). Stars outside stay as a faint twinkle.
  Move slowly → arpeggio as individual stars enter the light. Hold still → sustained harmony.
  Sweep broadly → a moving chord across the canvas.
  **"First kids prototype about exploration and revelation."** 165 prior prototypes respond to
  explicit gestures (tap, draw, drag, rhythm). Night Garden has no buttons, no tap targets.
  The whole canvas is one gesture field; the lantern is the key. A 3yo discovers that moving
  their finger slightly reveals a new sound; an older child deliberately hunts for all 16 stars.
  Inspired by Karel's loves of `133-kids-ripple-pond` ❤️ (canvas = instrument),

- **[/dream/165-cymatics](/dream/165-cymatics)** — Cymatics. `demoable`
  Chladni plate standing-wave patterns from audio. Each audio frequency resonates a
  distinct nodal-line pattern on a virtual square plate. 25 modes from simple (1,1) to
  complex (5,5) — a four-lobed cross, six-petaled flower, 50-cell symmetric grid.
  **Demo mode** sweeps a sine oscillator through all 25 modes at 3.5 s each; the pattern
  transforms continuously. **Recording mode** accepts a Resonance recording UUID →
  `/api/audio/[id]` → Karel's actual piano recordings drive mode selection in real time.
  Color follows the dominant FFT band (violet=bass, cyan=low-mid, emerald=mid, amber=high).
  **"Chladni figures are the literal physics behind the name 'Resonance.' This is what
  the app is named for — acoustic standing waves made visible."**
  Inspired by `138-lmdm-echo` ❤️ (Karel's recordings as audio input), `84-wave-fluid` ❤️

- **[/dream/164-kids-pendulum-harp](/dream/164-kids-pendulum-harp)** — Pendulum Harp (kids). `demoable`
  Five glowing pendulums hang from a bar at the top of a dark canvas. Each pendulum
  is a different length → different natural period → different speed of oscillation.
  Each time a bob swings through the bottom of its arc it plucks a pentatonic note
  (sine wave, bell-like decay). Longer pendulum = lower note = bigger bob (BANDIMAL
  rule). Tap any pendulum to push it — tap more pendulums and their different periods
  create an emergent polyrhythm that never simply repeats. All five start displaced
  on alternating sides so the canvas immediately plays without any touch needed.
  Sparkle burst on each pluck. C3+G3 ambient pad throughout.
  **"First kids prototype where physics sets the rhythm — not the child's timing."**
  163 prior prototypes fire notes on tap/drag/draw events. Pendulum Harp fires notes
  when a physically-simulated bob reaches its natural turning point. The child adds
  energy; gravity decides when each note plays. Same surprise-discovery mechanic as
  `133-kids-ripple-pond` ❤️ (collision fires the chord) and `109-kids-bounce-notes`
  (wall bounce fires the note), but now the timing emerges from pendulum physics rather
  than collision events.
  Directly inspired by Karel's loves of `105-pluck-field` ❤️ (tactile pluck = immediate note),

- **[/dream/163-paths-visualizer](/dream/163-paths-visualizer)** — Paths Visualizer. `demoable`
  Lorenz strange-attractor visualization that responds to audio in real time. The attractor
  trail is colored by frequency band (sub-bass = violet, treble = pink); bass energy drives the
  orbit scale; treble sharpens the line width. Six radial bloom gradients (one per band) pulse
  around the canvas center. A bass-onset ring expands on strong beats. **Demo mode** plays a
  synthesized piano phrase so the visualization works with zero setup. **Live mode** accepts a
  Resonance recording ID — calls `/api/audio/[id]` for a signed URL, routes the `<audio>` element
  through `MediaElementAudioSourceNode → AnalyserNode → destination`, and visualizes Karel's
  actual piano recordings from the Paths.
  **"First prototype that uses Karel's own recordings as the audio source for AV visualization."**
  Directly fulfills AGENT.md directive: "let his existing music be the input." Connected to love
  signal `138-lmdm-echo` ❤️ (Karel's piano phrase analyzed + echoed) — extends that concept to
  full-track real-time visualization.

  Colorful glowing bubbles drift upward through a dark canvas, swaying gently. Five bubble colors
  map to five pentatonic pitches (violet=C3, emerald=E3, amber=G3, rose=A3, cyan=C4).
  **Tap any bubble to pop it** — sparkle burst (18 particles) + triangle-wave note. **Drag your
  finger** across bubbles to pop a chain and play a fast melody or glissando. Bigger bubbles
  sing lower (BANDIMAL rule: radius 52→20). Two-oscillator triangle pair (+7¢ detuning) gives
  each note warmth; lower pitches ring longer (C3 = 0.72s decay, C4 = 0.40s). Bubbles respawn
  continuously — 10 seeded at start, new one every 1.2–1.9s, cap of 14 live. C3+G3 ambient pad
  keeps the canvas alive between pops. Fade-in on spawn (500ms), pop-ring expansion animation.
  **"First prototype where destruction is the musical act."** 161 prior prototypes reward touching,
  holding, or drawing. Bubble Pop rewards the pop — the release — the burst.
  Inspired by Karel's love of `105-pluck-field` ❤️ (tactile pluck = immediate note), `95-kids-breath-bubbles`

  Draw a freehand glowing stroke anywhere → it immediately loops as a pentatonic melody.
  **Four color zones** give four timbres: left=violet/piano (sine, crisp attack), mid-left=amber/bells
  (sine +8¢ detune, warm decay), mid-right=teal/chime (sine −6¢ detune, shorter decay),
  right=rose/pads (sine, slow 70ms attack, long sustain). **Y position = pitch** (C-major
  pentatonic, C3 bottom → C5 top). A glowing traversal dot sweeps each stroke's path in loop.
  Up to 4 simultaneous loops. **Tap any stroke to delete it** — sparkle burst. Clear resets.
  Demo mode seeds 3 loops at canvas open so the garden is immediately alive.
  **"First kids prototype combining freehand drawing + multi-timbral loop station."**

  Music as shape — not just color. Every audio feature maps to a different visual dimension on
  an accumulating Canvas2D: **spectral centroid → hue** (violet=low, rose=high), **spectral spread
  → shape** (circle=pure sine, triangle=slight overtones, square=mid spread, hexagon=wide spread,
  star=complex noise), **harmonic richness → inner ring count** (0–4 concentric rings),
  **amplitude → object scale**, **onset → spark burst**. Objects deposit every 4 frames with
  additive blending — overlapping shapes brighten, building a nebula-like visual record of the
  session. A 0.3%/frame fade prevents burn-in; the canvas takes ~3 min to naturally clear.
  **"First prototype to map audio to morphological shape — not just color."**
  158 prior prototypes map audio to color, fluid, particles, or geometry. None classify audio
  by *shape type*. A pure sine leaves circles; a chord leaves hexagons with inner rings; percussion
  leaves star bursts. The canvas is the acoustic biography of the session.

- **[/dream/158-kids-hum-paint](/dream/158-kids-hum-paint)** — Voice Painting (kids). `demoable`
  Sing or hum — your voice becomes a colored painting on a dark canvas. **High notes fly up,
  low notes drift down** (log-scale pitch → Y position). **Every pitch glows in its own hue**
  (low voice = warm amber/violet, high voice = cool cyan/rose). Amplitude controls stroke width:
  sing louder for a thicker brush. The painting accumulates in a left-to-right scroll, wrapping
  at the edge to fill the screen over a long session. Press **▶ Hear it!** — up to 56 sampled
  notes from the session play back as sine tones, replaying the session as a short melody.
  Demo mode auto-draws **Twinkle Twinkle** (no mic needed) — the visual shape of the opening
  C–C–G–G–A–A–G is recognizable as a pattern of flat stripes and jumps.
  **"First kids prototype where your voice is the paintbrush."** All 157 prior prototypes use
  touch (tap, drag, draw). This one replaces gesture with voice, unlocking vocal music-making
  without any reading or instruction. A 3yo humming randomly sees their voice trace a path;
  an older child can try to match the demo's color pattern by singing the right notes.

  A hexagonal radar chart where each of six vertices controls a named musical dimension:
  **Brightness** (filter), **Density** (BPM + voices), **Regularity** (timing jitter),
  **Complexity** (chord voicing), **Energy** (attack + gain), **Mode** (major→dim).
  Drag any vertex — the polygon reshapes and the synthesizer tracks immediately.
  Live chord name label updates as Complexity × Mode shift (C → Csus4 → Cm → Cdim9 etc.).
  Four presets: Classical Fugue, Dark Ambient, Jazz Improv, Drone.
  **"Navigate music as a space of named concepts — not moods, not knobs."**
  The six axes come from sparse autoencoder research (arxiv 2505.18186, May 2026): they are

  Thirteen glowing stars pre-placed on a dark sky in three loose clusters. **Draw a line from one
  star to a neighboring star** — both pitches ring as a two-voice interval (triangle waves, 1.8s
  decay). **Close a triangle** (connect all three sides) → three-note chord plays with staggered
  onset, the triangle interior shimmers pale blue, and 15 colored sparkles radiate from the centroid.
  Star color encodes pitch class: violet=C, emerald=E, amber=G, rose=A, cyan=C5.
  Soft C3+G3 ambient pad throughout. ↺ Clear resets all connections.
  **"First prototype where the musical structure is hidden in the sky — the child reveals it by connecting."**
  All 155 prior prototypes produce sound from tapping, dragging, or freehand drawing. This one
  produces an interval only when you connect two existing stars (the *relationship* is the sound),
  and a chord only when three stars form a closed triangle (the *graph structure* is the music theory).

- **[/dream/154-kids-clap-back](/dream/154-kids-clap-back)** — Clap Back (kids). `demoable`
  A call-and-response rhythm game for 4-year-olds. The prototype plays a 4-beat pattern —
  **violet circle glows bright on active beats, dim on rests** — then turns **green** ("your turn!")
  and runs the same 4-beat clock again. Child taps the screen on the active beats. **Big sparks**
  (22 particles) for on-beat taps within ±165ms (±22% of beat); **small sparks** (9 particles) for
  off-beat taps — never wrong, always rewarded, just bigger for timing. C4/E4/G4/A4 triangle plucks.
  Four beat-indicator dots below the circle show the pattern's shape. Soft C3+G3 ambient pad.
  **5 patterns cycle from easy to syncopated**: all-4 (learn tempo) → skip-3 → skip-2 → skip-4 → backbeat (2+4 only).
  **"First kids prototype where WHEN you tap is the parameter — not what you tap or where."**
  All 153 prior prototypes reward any tap within 50ms. Clap Back rewards timing: the same tap at a
  different moment in the 750ms beat window produces a dramatically different visual response.
  The three-phase color cycle (violet/demo → green/wait → cyan/listen) gives a child a clear
  procedural cue with no text needed. Inspired by Karel's love of `98-kids-drum-circle` ❤️.

  Dark canvas with 7-color palette, 3 brush sizes, BPM slider (40–160). **Paint a stroke — it
  immediately begins looping as a melody.** Stroke geometry is the musical score: Y position at each
  sampled point → pentatonic pitch (C2 bottom, C5 top); hue → waveform (warm=sawtooth, cool=sine,
  mid=triangle); X centroid → stereo pan; brush width → amplitude; arc length → note count (2–8).
  All voices loop simultaneously at the shared BPM. Flash animations travel along each stroke's note
  points, making the melody visible as a moving light sequence. Max 6 voices; oldest evicted on
  overflow — you edit by painting over. Clear resets; ↓ PNG saves the painting.
  **"What if painting and composing were the same act?"**
  Diagonal stroke = glissando. Wavy line = phrase rocking between registers. Horizontal = drone.
  Warm colors (rose/amber → sawtooth) sit forward in the mix; cool colors (cyan/blue → sine) recede.
  You mix by choosing hues.

  A dark night sky with 90 twinkling background stars. **Drag anywhere** — every ~46 px of travel
  a glowing 5-pointed star appears and plays a **Karplus-Strong pluck** (bell-like string resonance,
  pre-computed 2.5 s buffer per pitch). Y position = pitch: top of screen = C5 bright, bottom =
  C3 deep; 9 pitches across C-major pentatonic. Stars connect with glowing constellation lines as
  you draw. Lift your finger to lock the constellation into the sky. After 16 s, the constellation
  **arpeggios itself** — unique pitches replay from high to low over 3 s — then fades over 3.5 s.
  Up to 6 constellations coexist simultaneously, each on its own 22.5 s lifecycle. Soft C3+E3+G3
  ambient pad throughout. Hint text fades after 9 s ("Draw across the sky ✦").
  **"First kids prototype where the path you draw persists in the sky and then sings back at you."**
  150 prior prototypes are reactive (draw → immediate sound) or ephemeral (fades immediately).
  Star Song is the first where a drawing remains visible for 22 s after you stop, then spontaneously
  sings its own arpeggio — a small surprise reward for patience and long sessions. A child who
  draws a big swooping arc from bottom-left to top-right hears a full ascending scale 16 seconds
  later. A child who makes quick dots near the top hears high plucks. The spatial memory of
  "where I drew" persists as the sound memory of "what notes I made."
  Inspired by Karel's love of `105-pluck-field` ❤️ (KS synthesis) and `100-kids-paint-song` ❤️

  Each toss produces one hexagram line: heads majority = yang (solid), tails = yin (broken).
  After six tosses the complete hexagram appears (1 of 64), with its Chinese character, King Wen
  name, and a 2-sentence poetic interpretation. Press **Generate Journey Music** → `fal-ai/lyria3/pro`
  receives a music prompt derived from the hexagram's meaning and returns 30s of ambient music that
  plays through the 6-band bloom radial visualizer. **"Re-cast"** resets everything.
  **"First prototype to treat a Resonance session as a ritual act."**
  149 prior prototypes respond in real time. Oracle requires ceremony: six deliberate taps before
  any music appears. The I Ching's 64-hexagram emotional vocabulary maps onto music surprisingly
  well — hexagram 29 (The Abysmal) → deep water resonance; hexagram 58 (The Joyous) → bright

front page. Found **6 findings (§§209–214)** in RESEARCH.md. Seeded **3 new prototype ideas**
in IDEAS.md. Freshest find: I-Ching Music System (arXiv:2605.20386, May 2026). Most buildable
next seed: `150-ritual-compose` (I-Ching → Lyria, FAL_KEY ready, one cycle). Key research
insight: abstract AV scientifically outperforms realistic video at concert emotional peaks
(§210) — validates Resonance's design thesis.

  Three large colored circles on a dark canvas — rose (C3), amber (E3), violet (G3) — placed
  in a triangle. **Drag any circle** to move it. When two circles overlap their colors blend
  (screen compositing: rose+amber=orange, rose+violet=magenta, amber+violet=warm green) and
  their notes get louder together. When all three converge: the overlap zone glows **bright
  white** and a full C major chord rings out. The visual peak and auditory peak are simultaneous.
  Each isolated circle breathes with a gentle ±5px pulse to signal it's alive and waiting.
  Gain transitions via `setTargetAtTime(τ=50ms)` — no pops. Faint C/E/G labels inside each
  circle for parents; invisible to kids in play mode.
  **"First kids prototype where the proximity between three distinct objects IS the music."**
  All 47 prior kids prototypes respond to single-object events (tap, drag, hold, draw).

- **[/dream/147-kids-beat-pulse](/dream/147-kids-beat-pulse)** — Beat Pulse (kids). `demoable`
  A large glowing circle pulses at a steady BPM. Each beat: the circle flashes a pentatonic color
  (C3→E3→G3→A3→C4 cycling), a quiet metronome pluck fires, and the note name briefly appears
  inside the circle. **Tap anywhere** — sparks fly and a louder note plays. **On-beat taps**
  (within ±154ms at 70 BPM) produce 20 sparks + a secondary burst from the circle center; off-beat
  taps produce 9. No score, no fail state. A thin progress arc sweeps clockwise once per beat,
  giving an advance cue. BPM +/− buttons (±10, 40–120 BPM).
  **"First kids prototype about temporal attention — tapping with a pulse, not just tapping."**
  46 prior kids prototypes reward any tap, regardless of timing. Beat Pulse rewards *when* you tap —
  via a non-judgmental bigger-sparkle gradient. A 3yo enjoys the sparks; a 5yo chases the beat.

  12-o'clock, the note name (C3, E3, G3, A3, or C4) appears in white (75% opacity) above the
  striker tip, fading over 600ms. Fires on the startup chime too. Makes the prototype gently
  educational — a parent can name the notes; the child just taps and hears music. 12-line edit.

- **[/dream/146-eco-bloom](/dream/146-eco-bloom)** — Eco Bloom. `demoable`
  A procedural rainforest grows before you. Three tree species (20°/30°/40° branch angle, depth 6/5/4)
  unfold simultaneously from seeds at the canvas bottom using recursive L-system branching. Each new
  branch segment plays a **Karplus-Strong pluck** (physical string model: delay-line feedback on seeded
  noise). Depth maps to pitch — shallow trunks = low register, fine terminal twigs = high. All pitches
  C-major pentatonic; three simultaneous trees = three-voice polyphony that's always consonant.
  Leaf clusters accumulate at terminal branches, rotating gently in virtual wind. Background fades from
  near-black toward deep forest green as canopy density increases. **Rain toggle** (white noise through
  lowpass 1.1 kHz). **Bird calls toggle** (rapid 5-note arpeggio every 8 s, appears after ~18 s).
  **"First prototype where patient growth over time is the primary musical metaphor."** 142 prior
  prototypes were reactive or event-driven. Eco Bloom rewards watching. Tap canvas to plant more trees
  (max 6). Clear resets to fresh seeds. Directly inspired by Refik Anadol's DATALAND: Machine Dreams:

  Six glowing colored dots in a row (C major pentatonic: violet=C3 → rose=E4). A bright white
  cursor sweeps left to right continuously. **Tap any dot to light it up** — when the cursor
  passes a lit dot, that note plays. Tap again to turn it off. The result is a one-bar loop
  that plays forever at the current BPM. +/− buttons adjust speed (40–160 BPM in 16 BPM steps).
  Full-column tap zones (canvas height × column width) give generous hit targets. All pentatonic
  combinations are consonant — no wrong patterns.
  **"First kids prototype where the child constructs a musical pattern that then plays itself."**
  All 144 prior prototypes are reactive (tap → immediate note) or event-driven. This is the
  first where a child builds a looping composition by deliberate gesture, then observes it play.

  split, emerald twigs extend, amber tips bloom with fluttering leaves. **Each branch plays a
  Karplus-Strong pluck as it reaches its tip** — C3 from the trunk rising to C4 at the tips,
  all C-major pentatonic. Plant up to 4 seeds; their trees grow and sing simultaneously in

  (C=violet, cycling chromatically); saturation = quality (major=vivid, minor=desaturated).
  A 12-bin chromagram at the bottom shows which pitch classes are active; active chord tones
  (root, third, fifth) highlight brighter with a colored underline.
  **First prototype to name musical structure.** 140 prior prototypes react to audio signal
  properties — energy, spectrum, pitch. This one says "that's an F♯ minor." Algorithm: chroma

  Hold two fingers on the dark canvas — a glowing string stretches between them and sings.
  **Closer fingers = shorter string = higher note** (same physical law as guitar/kalimba).
  Moving fingers >12 px "plucks" the string (triangle wave, 12ms attack, 450ms decay).
  Visual: standing-wave animation — fundamental mode shape `sin(π×t)×cos(2π×phase)`, vibration
  rate proportional to pitch (0.8 Hz at C2, 5.5 Hz at C5). Color shifts violet→amber with pitch.
  Single finger anchors at canvas center for solo thereminvox play — pulling away lowers pitch,
  approaching raises it. 3-octave C-major pentatonic (C2–C5, 13 steps). Faint note-name label
  fades with the vibration. Amplitude floor 0.18 while held; faster fade on release.
  **"The gap between your fingers is the instrument."** First kids prototype where the

- **[/dream/138-lmdm-echo](/dream/138-lmdm-echo)** — Echo Chamber. `demoable`
  Record a piano phrase (up to 15 seconds). While you play, real-time harmonic analysis accumulates: 12-bin chroma vector → chord quality (major/minor/neutral), onset detection → BPM estimate, spectral centroid → register (low/mid/high). After you stop, the three features combine into an ACE-Step style prompt and generate a 30-second AI piano echo. Both tracks play back simultaneously — your original panned left (−35°), the AI echo panned right (+35°) — through a shared six-band bloom visualizer. Waveform strips show both tracks with a live progress cursor.
  **"The echo responds to the musical meaning of the phrase, not its timbre."** Inspired by the "generative delay" concept from arXiv:2605.22717: AI-generated music as an expressive delay unit — you play, the system processes harmonic meaning, a transformed version returns. Unlike `44-vocal-bgm` (audio-to-audio seeding), this uses text-to-audio where the prompt is derived from analysis. Unlike `33-aria-companion` (immediate Markov note response), this waits for a complete phrase then delivers a longer AI reply.

- **[/dream/137-kids-hold-glow](/dream/137-kids-hold-glow)** — Hold & Glow (kids). `demoable`
  Hold anywhere on a dark screen. A glowing orb of light appears at your touch — the longer you hold, the brighter and wider it grows (core radius 28 → 92 px over 4 seconds; halo 22% → 50% opacity). Release: the glow "exhales" as a fading ring expands outward. Ring size and speed scale with hold duration — long holds launch big fast rings, quick taps leave small slow ones. Five left→right color zones map to C-major pentatonic (violet=C3, rose=E3, amber=G3, emerald=A3, cyan=C4). Multi-touch: up to 5 simultaneous orbs = 5-note chord. Hint text visible when pond is empty.
  **"First kids prototype where hold-duration is the musical parameter."** All 35 prior kids prototypes respond to tap-down events (tap, drag, draw, tilt). This one rewards stillness. The two-phase breath structure — tension while holding (glow grows), exhale on release (ring expands) — is completely new to the zone. Contemplative, headphone-beautiful, suitable before sleep. Loved prototypes `100-kids-paint-song` and `104-kids-mirror-draw` (both involve sustained deliberate gesture) inspired the direction.

Each interval holds for 12 seconds then glides to the next over 12 seconds — 144s total cycle. Four audio voices: root sine, sub-Hz LFO for beating, harmony sine tracking the current ratio, quiet octave warmth. **Mic mode** detects your sung pitch via autocorrelation and retunes the entire drone to your voice. Ratio clock visual shows all six intervals as nodes on a circle; a glowing dot sweeps clockwise through them; inner arc tracks hold vs. glide phase. Background hue blends between interval color palettes.
  **"The first prototype where the interval itself is the subject."** Previous harmonic prototypes (`105-pluck-field`, `107-ocean-presence`) use harmony as texture. Kali Sustain makes the ratio the foreground: you watch and hear exactly which interval is sounding and when it changes. The 7∶4 harmonic seventh sits outside 12-TET and always surprises. Inspired by Kali Malone's pipe organ just-intonation work.

Crown ring of 6 sky-blue spheres at the top of the stalk. Bloom post-processing from `@react-three/postprocessing`. Demo mode breathes with internal LFOs; mic mode makes it fully reactive to live sound. Dark background, no UI chrome during playback.

Multi-touch: each finger drops its own ripple. The whole-screen is the instrument — no buttons to find, no wrong taps. The physics of wave interference teaches itself through play: drop two stones far apart, watch the rings spread, wait for the moment they touch and sing together.

  Eight sine waves across eight octaves, each fading in at the bottom of the audible range and out at the top. All eight glide upward together. Result: **an auditory illusion of a tone that ascends forever without ever resolving**. Discovered by Roger Shepard (1964) — the most famous auditory illusion in music. RATE slider (0.5–30 BPM), Ascending/Descending toggle, three modes: Glide (smooth), Whole-tone (6 discrete steps per octave — you hear the major whole-tone scale ascending), Semitone (12 steps — slower, textbook-clear). Freeze button holds the current 8-oscillator chord. Phase ring (bottom-right) orbits once per octave traversal; center shows current note name (A, Bb, B, C...). Canvas: 8 glowing circles (A1=bottom, A8=top), brightness/size ∝ bell-curve gain, hue cycles violet→rose→amber as each octave completes.
  **"A tone that climbs forever. The staircase has no top floor."** First psychoacoustics/auditory illusion prototype in the sandbox. Resonance angle: the Shepard tone proves perceptual ascent can be unbounded — the listener travels far without going anywhere. That IS the journey thesis.

  Five glowing planets orbit a central sun, each on its own ring. **Tap any ring** → a planet appears at your tap angle, plays its note (triangle + 2nd harmonic, reverb tail), and begins orbiting. Inner planets spin faster and sing higher (C4/3.5s period); outer planets are slow and low (C3/13s). Each planet plays its note again on every completed orbit — place all five and listen to the polyrhythm build. Tap an occupied ring to teleport its planet to a new angle and retrigger its note. **"Clear"** button resets everything. No reading required; the five orbit rings are visible as faint dashed circles the moment you start.
  **"Five rings. Five notes. Each planet makes its own rhythm — together they make music that's impossible to predict."** First kids prototype about polyrhythm-from-physics (joins `109-kids-bounce-notes` and `83-kids-tilt-rain` in the "physics autonomously makes music" family).

Each fish is a fixed pitch: violet=C3 (lowest), rose=G4 (highest) — color is the sonic label. Multi-touch: tap two fish at once for two simultaneous notes. School always moving — the canvas is never static. Body waggle (±7° oscillation) gives each fish its own tail-driven swimming rhythm.

  Five glowing starfish rest on an ocean floor. **Touch any starfish** → it wiggles (arms ripple outward in a decaying wave) and plays a full 5-note pentatonic chord (all five notes sound simultaneously, ~900ms reverb tail). Each starfish plays a different chord: violet (biggest, left) = C3 cluster; pink = E3 cluster; amber (biggest overall) = G3 cluster; emerald (smallest) = A3 cluster; blue = C4 cluster. Bigger starfish = lower chord — size maps to pitch register without any label. Tapping multiple starfish at once plays multiple chords. All combinations are within C-major pentatonic: no dissonance possible. Ocean-floor background: seaweed sways with slow `sin()` drift, 10 micro-bubbles rise continuously, sandy floor gradient at the bottom.

Each jellyfish is a fixed pitch in C-major pentatonic: biggest (violet, radius 46px) = lowest (C3), smallest (teal, radius 22px) = highest (C4). The physical size→pitch mapping (BANDIMAL's bar-height rule) teaches itself without text. Jellyfish wrap top-to-bottom so the ocean is never empty. Autonomous drift keeps it alive between touches.

- **[/dream/124-image-chord](/dream/124-image-chord)** — Image Chord. `demoable`
  Drop any photo, screenshot, or artwork → JS samples a 64×64 thumbnail, builds a weighted hue histogram, and reads out dominant H/S/L. The mapping: **hue → chord quality** (warm reds = C major, yellows = C7, greens = Cm, cyan = Cm7, violet = Cmaj7, magenta/purple = Cdim); **saturation → harmonic richness** (near-grey image = 1 pure sine; vivid image = 4 triangle-wave voices with slight detuning); **brightness → register + tempo** (dark = bass C2 at 35 BPM, bright = treble C5 at 120 BPM). The chord arpeggios continuously; a 6-band bloom ring animates to the synth output. **8 journey-palette swatches** (Cosmic, Earth, Sanctuary, Ocean, Snowflake, Ghost, Fire, Mycelium) for instant exploration — no image needed. Chord name displayed in large monospace over the bloom.

- **[/dream/123-landscape-resonance](/dream/123-landscape-resonance)** — Landscape Resonance. `demoable`
  Audio-reactive 3D terrain fly-through rendered in raw WebGL + GLSL (no Three.js). A ray-marched heightfield derived from 5-octave FBM value noise. **Bass lifts mountains**: louder playing = towering peaks, the camera rises to match so they loom at the screen edges. **Treble adds surface roughness**: a second noise octave makes the terrain more jagged at high frequencies. **Onsets** trigger a 100ms blue-white lightning flash. **Fog** thickens with overall amplitude (quiet = clear far horizon, loud = atmospheric blur). Color gradient: deep violet valleys → emerald slopes → near-white peaks; the entire gradient shifts dynamically with bass scale. Forward fly-through speed: 0.38 units/sec (a full terrain feature takes ~47 seconds — deliberately slow and meditative). Demo mode: three LFO oscillators (55/180/440 Hz) with amplitude-modulating sub-LFOs create a slow breathing terrain without mic. Live performance: bass-driven mountain peaks on a projector screen would be genuinely cinematic.

- **[/dream/122-kids-firefly-song](/dream/122-kids-firefly-song)** — Firefly Song (kids). `demoable`
  Ten glowing fireflies drift across a dark canvas, each carrying a pentatonic note. **Touch a firefly** — it flashes brighter and sings its note while following your finger. **Lift your finger** — it scatters in a new direction. Catch two or three simultaneously for an instant chord. Each firefly has a unique color (violet → rose, mapping low → high pitch on the C-major pentatonic scale). The "chase" interaction introduces intentional aiming without a fail state — miss a firefly and a sparkle note plays, and a new firefly appears nearby. Fireflies drift in slowly-curving Lissajous paths with gentle wall bounces and mild pointer repulsion (they sense your finger and ease away). Soft ambient C+E+G pad keeps it from going silent.

  Four-slot live loop station. Pick bar count (1/2/4) → tap REC → play → tap STOP → it loops, phase-locked to the beat grid. Each slot has a live waveform with a sweeping playhead, MUTE and CLEAR controls, and independent bar counts. First prototype where you actively *construct* a composition over time rather than reacting. "Load Demo Loops" generates a C2 drone + piano arpeggio + high figure + kick/snare for an instant layered performance without mic. BPM tap tempo adjusts bar length for new recordings.

  Four weather clouds drop pentatonic notes from the sky. Each cloud has its own pitch (C3, E3, G3, A3) and its own physics: rain (fast teardrops, quick plunk), snow (slow flakes, sine sustain), leaves (tumbling ellipses, warm tone). Tap any cloud to cycle its weather. All four pitches are pentatonic-consonant — any combination sounds musical. Zero permissions · Zero deps · 2.78 kB.

## Previous (Cycle 141 — adult build)

- **[/dream/119-poem-fluid](/dream/119-poem-fluid)** — Poem Fluid. `demoable`
  A WebGL Navier-Stokes fluid sim where the **turbulence state of the water drives a Markov chain text layer**. Start in **Still water** mode: the canvas is near-black, dark teal wisps drift slowly, and full Ghost-narrative sentences surface one at a time — "The water remembers every sound that has passed through this place." Now **drag your finger** to stir. The turbulence score rises; sentences fragment into phrases, then single words, then a cascade of fragments at different positions. Release — the fluid stills — and sentences begin to surface again. Add mic: audio onsets spike turbulence (beat = shatters a sentence into words), bass drives pressure pulses that add swirling velocity to the water.
  Inspired by Memo Akten & Katie Hofstadter's *The Thinking Ocean* (Whitney Museum Artport, 2026): generative text that lives in the physical state of the fluid, not on top of it.

- **[/dream/118-kids-mirror-melody](/dream/118-kids-mirror-melody)** — Mirror Melody (kids). `demoable`
  A split canvas: rose on the left, cyan on the right. **Draw on either half** — glowing dots trail your finger and play a pentatonic note in real time (Y=pitch, top=high). The **mirror path appears instantly** on the opposite half in the complementary color, playing the same note panned to the other ear. Two-voice stereo duet from a single gesture. Paths accumulate and fade over 7 seconds; a soft ambient C–G–C pad fills any silence. Multi-touch: two fingers create two independent mirror pairs simultaneously.
  **"Left hand / right hand — draw both at once."** The prototype is its own music theory lesson: holding a finger high on both sides creates a two-voice unison; drawing one finger high and one low creates a two-voice interval. A 4yo discovers this in under 30 seconds without any instruction.

- **[/dream/117-data-cosm](/dream/117-data-cosm)** — DATA-COSM. `demoable`
  Ryoji Ikeda aesthetic brought to the browser. A full-canvas scrolling matrix of **synthetic particle physics events** in CERN CMS format (`[μ+] pt=  48.3 eta= -1.270 phi=  2.950 m=0.1060 q=+1`) rendered in monospace on pure black. Every new event: characters **scatter from random offsets then snap into place** (300ms), a sine pulse fires at the current scale's tone frequency, trail particles arc upward. A continuous **sub-bass 38Hz drone** underlies — felt not heard.
  Three **temporal scales** auto-advance every 40s with a white flash + scatter-all transition:
  - **QUANTUM** — 8 events/s, 4kHz tones, 10px font, 90px/s scroll: dense flickering number matrix
  - **BIOLOGICAL** — 1 event/s, 440Hz tones, slower cadence: graceful, measured
  - **COSMIC** — 1 event/10s, 110Hz sub-bass tone, 20px font, centered on black: a single event worth contemplating
  "All of nature's data is the same material." The three scales comment on each other — the identical data format means completely different things at different temporal densities.

- **[/dream/116-kids-bloom-garden](/dream/116-kids-bloom-garden)** — Bloom Garden (kids). `polished`
  A dark canvas that breathes. **Press and hold** anywhere to plant a glowing flower — it blooms over 650ms from a tiny bud into a 5-petal flower and plays a sustained pentatonic note (X position = pitch: violet/low left → rose/high right). After 10 seconds the flower **seeds itself**: petals scatter as sparkles and a new bud sprouts 30–62px away, inheriting the pitch ±1 note. **Tap any flower to burst it** — sparkle explosion + pop note. Up to 12 flowers coexist; the garden self-organizes over time toward harmonic clusters as notes drift ±1 each generation.
  **Cycle 146 polish**: added a growing violet press-ring — a progress arc sweeps from 12 o'clock clockwise during the 480ms hold, so users always know "keep holding." The ring disappears the instant the flower starts growing. No more "why didn't that work?" moments for kids.
  **"The most contemplative kids prototype yet — designed for quiet play before sleep."** No tap targets. No fail state. No goal. Hold → bloom → watch the garden grow itself. Ambient C3+E3+G3 pad so the screen is never silent even before the first flower.

- **[/dream/115-kids-weather-music](/dream/115-kids-weather-music)** — Weather Music (kids). `demoable`
  Touch anywhere on screen — you're inside that weather zone. ☀️ Sun (top-right): bright C-major arpeggios + golden rotating rays. ☁️ Cloud (top-left): soft Am chord pad + drifting grey puffs. 🌧️ Rain (bottom-left): falling pentatonic drops + blue streaks. 💨 Wind (bottom-right): sweeping glissando oscillator + horizontal emerald streaks. **Drag between corners to blend all four atmospheres continuously** — the transition from Sun to Rain produces a natural musical diminuendo that a 4yo discovers by accident. Multi-touch: two fingers in different corners blend both sounds simultaneously.
  **"No notes to tap, no characters to find — the whole screen is four blended weather instruments."** First kids prototype about sustained atmospheric states (hold) rather than discrete events (tap). Bilinear zone weights from pointer position (x × (1−y) = sun, etc.) — mathematically smooth in all directions.

- **[/dream/114-live-harmonize](/dream/114-live-harmonize)** — Live Harmonize. `demoable`
  Play a melody into the mic — the system detects your key in real time (chroma template matching) and immediately plays diatonic 3rd and 5th harmony voices alongside each note. The third voice pans slightly right; the fifth pans slightly left. A scrolling piano roll records all three parts: melody in warm orange, 3rd in blue, 5th in indigo. Demo mode plays a Bach BWV 772 fragment with pre-set C major key.
  **"Play a melody — two harmony voices appear, always in your key."** Diatonic intervals change per scale degree (E in C major gets G minor-third and B fifth; B gets D and dim-5th F) — not mechanical fixed-interval transposition. Key display updates live as you play.

  Drag your finger anywhere — a glowing wand follows it, leaving a rainbow color trail. Y position = pitch (pentatonic, top=high, bottom=low). Drag speed = note rate: slow sweep → long sustained tones; fast sweep → rapid arpeggios. Quick tap → drum hit (noise burst). Choose from 4 orchestras before starting: **Playground** 🎪 (bright triangle waves, amber), **Space** 🚀 (slow-attack sine waves, violet), **Forest** 🌲 (warm triangle, emerald), **Ocean** 🌊 (flowing sine with 3-note drone, cyan). Ambient drone chord for that orchestra plays quietly always — canvas never goes silent. Demo mode auto-conducts a Lissajous figure until first touch (wand already moving = no cold start).
  **"Your finger is the conductor's baton."** First kids prototype where a single continuous gesture controls both pitch AND rhythm simultaneously. No buttons, no tap targets — the whole screen is the instrument.

- **[/dream/112-bio-echo](/dream/112-bio-echo)** — Bio Echo. `demoable`
  Play piano into the mic — watch a forest grow, layer by layer, in real time. Five frequency strata map to five ecological layers: **sub-bass grows root tendrils** (deep violet lines crawling upward with Brownian drift); **bass builds the trunk** (amber pillar that only grows, never shrinks — every bass-heavy passage is permanently recorded in its height); **mid blooms the canopy** (emerald leaf-ellipses accumulating at 34–61% canvas height); **onsets send birds** (each attack fires a white bezier wing-arc into the sky — play 60 attacks and the sky fills with birds); **treble fills the sky** (tiny white star-dots at top 14%).
  The canvas never clears — by the end of a piece, a complete forest ecosystem has grown that encodes the entire musical session. Download as PNG.
  **"Every frequency band is a layer of the forest — sub-bass digs the roots, treble lights the sky."** Inspired by Refik Anadol's DATALAND (opens June 20, 2026, LA). Trunk gradient from accumulation (no gradient code — the canvas's own physics creates it).

- **[/dream/111-kids-shape-loop](/dream/111-kids-shape-loop)** — Shape Loop (kids). `demoable`
  Draw any closed shape with your finger — when it closes, a glowing traversal dot orbits the perimeter and triggers a pentatonic note at each of the evenly-spaced trigger points (small colored dots on the shape). **Y position = pitch**: draw a tall shape and hear high notes; draw a wide flat shape and hear mid-register loops; draw a circle for a near-constant-pitch drone. Draw multiple shapes — each loops independently, creating polyphonic layers. Tap any existing shape to erase it. Auto-close: a dashed ring near the start point shows where to return to — when your finger enters it, the shape closes and starts playing immediately.
  **"Your drawing loops as a melody forever."** First kids prototype about additive compositional layering — the child doesn't react to something, they construct a composition by drawing.

  Point your camera at anything — the image becomes a chord. Dominant hue → chord quality (warm reds=major, cool blues=minor, violets=diminished, greens=suspended, pinks=augmented). Brightness → register (dark=C2 bass, bright=C4 treble). Saturation → harmonic richness (1–3 triangle-wave voices per chord tone). Frame delta → arpeggio vs pad. Split view: left = camera feed with colored quadrant zone borders, right = 6-band bloom ring from the synthesis AnalyserNode (shows chord harmonics). Demo mode cycles all 5 chord qualities without camera permission.
  **"Point at a plant, a painting, a window. Each one plays a different chord."** First prototype where musical output is fully determined by where you look. Inspired by LUMIA (arxiv 2512.17228, Dec 2025). Zero API · Zero ML · webcam optional · 4.66 kB.

  A glowing ball bounces around the canvas with gravity and elastic reflections. Each wall plays a different pentatonic note: **bottom=C3** (deep, satisfying), **top=A4** (bright, tingly), **left=G3** and **right=E4** (mid). Ball lights up on impact (flash glow), dims between bounces. **Tap anywhere to spawn a new ball** at that position — up to 5 balls playing simultaneously. More balls = richer self-playing music. The child sets physics in motion; physics makes the music.
  **"A ball bounces. The wall sings back."** First kids prototype where the music is autonomous — the child doesn't need to keep tapping to keep the sound going. Inspired by the Bouncy / Sound Drop paradigm.

  A frequency-attention practice in six movements. Six 22-second windows, each one spotlighting a different frequency register in the radial bloom viz: sub-bass (20–60 Hz, deep violet), bass (60–250 Hz, cyan), low-midrange (250–500 Hz, green), midrange (500 Hz–2 kHz, yellow), high-midrange (2–4 kHz, orange), treble (4–20 kHz, magenta). When a window is active, its ring blazes at full brightness; all other rings dim to 8% opacity. A text prompt per window tells you what to listen for. **File mode**: drag any audio file onto the page — Karel's own recordings, a Welcome Home track, anything.

  A musical conversation with a parrot 🦜. The bird sings a 2–4 note phrase — colored circles light up as it plays. Then it's your turn: tap any of the 5 colored circles to sing back. After 4 taps or 3 seconds, the bird echoes your notes back and adds one new note of its own. The conversation loops and grows; phrases get longer each round (max 4 notes). C major pentatonic — no wrong combinations. The bird's "add one note" mechanic is gently educational: if a child taps the same note four times, the bird mirrors it then introduces a new color.

Each orb makes its own music (Cosmic = detuned pad; Earth = deep bass; Sanctuary = FM warmth; Ocean = C major chord; Snowflake = crystalline highs; Ghost = A-minor arpeggio). Orbit with mouse/touch: the orb your camera faces fills the mix. Turn away — it fades. Every other orb holds at a quiet floor (3%) so they're audible in the background as you pass. The transition is instant — `cos²` falloff snaps focus clearly. Glowing spheres swell and brighten as they come into focus. HUD shows the name + tagline of the journey you're currently facing.

  Draw a line with your finger — lift up to hear your melody play. The screen is a dark starry canvas. As you drag, a glowing sparkle trail appears behind your finger: dots colored by pitch (violet at left / low notes → pink at right / high notes). When you lift, the path plays back as a melody — each sparkle flashes bright when its note fires. Left side = C3 (low, violet); right side = A4 (high, pink); 10 pentatonic notes mapped across the full screen width. Notes are triangle-wave piano tones (60ms attack, ~550ms decay). Multiple paths persist and fade gently over 6 seconds — draw a new one while the last is still visible. A subtle pitch-gradient strip at the bottom (violet→pink) shows the note mapping without text. No reading required, no fail state. A child who draws left→right hears an ascending scale; right→left hears a descent; a squiggle hears a wandering tune.

  Side-by-side speed and quality comparison of two FAL music-generation backends. Pick one of five presets (Forest Dawn, Stone Chamber, Cosmic Drift, Jazz Sketch, Ocean Breath) or type freeform tags, then hit **Generate Both** — both backends start simultaneously. Left panel (violet) runs CassetteAI (`cassetteai/music-generator`, distilled model, ~2s); right panel (cyan) runs ACE-Step (`fal-ai/ace-step`, full diffusion, ~20–40s). Each panel shows a live millisecond timer, then a waveform strip on completion, then a ▶ Play button. Playback feeds a six-band bloom visualizer (violet→cyan→green→yellow→orange→magenta).

  Six large colored percussion pads in a 3×2 grid — red (kick), orange (snare), yellow (hihat), teal (tom), blue (clap), purple (shaker). Tap any pad to play its synthesized drum sound: kick is a sine sweep 150→40 Hz; snare is bandpass noise + short 200 Hz sine body; hihat is highpass noise above 7 kHz; tom is a slower sine sweep 110→55 Hz; clap is a double bandpass noise burst (0 ms + 22 ms apart — the gap between bursts is the perceptual cue for "clap"); shaker is highpass noise above 5.5 kHz. Background canvas draws expanding colored rings from each tap point. CSS scale (0.88) + bright glow on press. Quiet C/E/G ambient pad from first tap. Multi-touch: every finger gets its own ring. Zero permissions, zero API, zero deps. Min pad size 26vmin (≥80px).
  **"Six colors, six sounds — the first kids prototype about rhythm rather than pitch."** All 10 previous kids prototypes use C-major pentatonic melodic notes. This is the first pure percussion prototype — tap a rhythm, layer sounds, no music theory needed.

  Simulate a physical room and hear how it changes your piano. Draw a rectangular room (1.5–60m wide, up to 80m deep), pick wall/floor materials (Stone α=0.03 → Carpet α=0.40), and press **▶ play chord** — a C-major chord sounds in that space via a Web Audio `ConvolverNode` loaded with the computed impulse response. The image-source method computes up to 3rd-order reflections; RT60 (Sabine estimate) updates live and color-codes from studio-dry to cathedral-vast. Drag the amber ♪ source and violet 👂 listener dots to reposition; IR rebuilds automatically. 9 presets: Closet · Bedroom · Studio · Hall · Concert Hall · Cathedral · Cave · Stone Chamber · Forest Clearing.
  **"Move a wall. Hear the room change."** The Stone Chamber preset sounds ringy and metallic (RT60 ≈ 2.5s, stone everywhere); the Cathedral is vast and blurred (RT60 ≈ 3.8s); the Closet is almost silent-dry (RT60 ≈ 0.08s, carpet).

  Full-screen canvas instrument for two simultaneous players. Each touch contact gets a glowing colored orb — first finger = violet, second = rose. Y-position maps to a pentatonic pitch (C3–C5); slide up = higher note, slide down = lower. The pentatonic constraint guarantees any two simultaneous notes sound beautiful together — no wrong combinations possible. Smooth pitch glide (fretless feel). When both voices are active, an animated dashed gradient line connects them visually. Sparkle particle trail on movement. Idle hint: two pulsing colored dots show where to put fingers.

  Two sliders control the entire DX7 timbre space — C:M ratio (which harmonic series) and β
  modulation index (how rich/noisy). The right panel shows the **live sideband spectrum** as
  Bessel function coefficients J_n(β): you see exactly why DX Piano at β=2.5 has almost no

- **[/dream/68-wgsl-synth](/dream/68-wgsl-synth)** — WGSL Synth. `demoable`
  Write a WebGPU shader that responds to your playing — live, in the browser.
  Split-screen: left = WGSL fragment shader (editable textarea); right = fullscreen WebGPU canvas.
  Six pre-wired audio uniforms: **uBass, uMid, uTreble, uOnset, uTime, uBPM** (+ uResX/uResY) — fed
  every frame from the AnalyserNode or demo LFOs. Edit any line; shader recompiles 400ms later.
  Errors shown with line numbers; the last valid pipeline keeps running — no black frames.
  Default shader: pulsing radial rings + grid shimmer + onset flash, HSV color cycle.
  Demo: LFO oscillators animate the shader without mic permissions. Mic: play piano — bass expands
  the rings, chords shimmer the grid, a sharp attack flashes white.
  **The lowest-level tool in the sandbox**: write raw WGSL; audio is the parameter.
  Natural partner to `claude-shader` (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY pending) which writes the WGSL for you.

- **[/dream/67-structure-viz](/dream/67-structure-viz)** — Structure Viz. `demoable`
  Your music as a map of itself. Every 1.5 seconds: capture FFT → 32 log-spaced feature bins →
  normalized vector. Compute the N×N **self-similarity matrix** (cosine similarity). Display as a
  heatmap: dark purple = dissimilar, bright white = same material. The diagonal is always white.
  Checkerboard kernel novelty function detects section boundaries; greedy similarity clustering
  assigns labels A / B / A′ / C — matching letter means recurring material.
  **Demo (▶ ABA)**: three oscillator phases (C3 chord → A4 chord → C3 returns). By bar 22 (≈33s)
  you see the classic "three bright blocks along the diagonal" with two bright off-diagonal corners
  confirming that A = A′. The timeline strip below shows `A | B | A′`.
  **Mic mode**: play any music — verse-chorus-verse, theme-variation-return, anything with
  recurring sections will produce off-diagonal bright squares.
  **First prototype that shows structure rather than content** — not what frequencies are present,
  but how sections relate. 66 prior prototypes visualize audio signal; this one visualizes form.

  that cloned voice, with physical action tags embedded in the text: `[sigh]`, `[gasp]`, `[slowly]`,
  `[flatly]`, `[long pause]`. Six scene cards with editable lines, waveform per scene, exaggeration
  slider (0.0–1.0). Six concurrent API calls fire on "Generate Ghost voices." Without a reference
  clip, Chatterbox uses its default voice.
  First prototype where the Ghost can speak in **Karel's own voice** — or any voice from a 5-second clip.
  Four TTS paradigms now compared: Gemini (global style) / Orpheus (per-word XML) / ElevenLabs V3
  (per-phrase acting) / Chatterbox (voice-clone + physical action tags).

- **[/dream/65-dialogue-score](/dream/65-dialogue-score)** — Dialogue Score. `demoable`
  Contour-mirroring AI piano dialogue. Play a phrase (8+ notes + 2s silence); the system detects
  its melodic shape — ascending ↗, descending ↘, arch ∧, valley ∨, or neutral — then generates
  Aria's response with the **same contour**. Markov chain biases note choices from your playing
  history; contour constraint enforces pitch direction at each step. Both work together.
  Ghost notes (dashed blue) appear before Aria plays — full anticipation preview from `39-anticipate`.
  Header shows: `your phrase ↗ ascending → aria mirrors → aria responds ↗ ascending`.
  Demo: C major scale ascending → Aria responds ascending. First prototype where Aria's response
  has musical logic, not just statistical probability. "The AI mirrors your musical thought."

  voiced by ElevenLabs V3 with inline emotional tags embedded per phrase: `[slowly, reverently]`, `[pauses]`,
  `[whispers]`, `[awed]`, `[infinite calm]`, `[long pause]`. Ghost uses Adam voice (deep, measured);
  Visitor uses Alice voice (lighter, questioning). Three API calls per scene, played sequentially with
  550ms silence between turns.
  Canvas: two glowing orbs separated by a vertical divider — Ghost amber-warm left, Visitor cool-blue right.
  Active speaker's orb pulses with live amplitude data; an expanding ring marks speaking. All six scenes
  pre-scripted with editable textareas; V3 tag hints in the UI.
  Stone Chamber: *"[slowly] The resonance here [pauses] is ancient."* · *"[nervous, awed] I didn't know it would feel this alive."* · *"[whispers] Everything that ever sounded here — still does."*

  Three inputs → one composition. Pick a **Ghost scene** (Stone Chamber, Root Portal, Underground Pool,
  Tiny Planet, Forest Dawn, Cosmic Ascension), pick a **mood word** (meditative / dreaming / ascending /
  melancholic / ethereal / grounded / tense / vast), and optionally **hum a melody** into the mic
  (up to 15s). The live "ACE-STEP PROMPT" panel shows exactly how the three inputs combine into tags.

  - **ElevenLabs Music composition_plan confirmed (§118)** — `fal-ai/elevenlabs/music` accepts `sections[].lines` for per-section lyrics. Ghost journey as a **sung** AI piece: each of the 6 scenes as a music section with the Ghost character's own lines. $2.40/3-min generation. Inspires `lyrics-journey` (build when budget confirmed).

  - **`music-palette` (§120, zero deps/API)** — Music2Palette (ACM MM 2025) proved that audio → emotion → 5-color palette is a real cross-modal alignment. Browser-native zero-dep approximation via existing arousal/valence audio pipeline. **Build next cycle.** Most novel per build cost.

  - **`collage-compose` (§121)** — Mozualization (CHI 2025): multimodal music gen from image + audio clip + keyword. In browser: extract image color temperature + hum pitch contour → rich ACE-Step prompt. More precise than text-only. FAL_KEY in use, $0.006/track.

  6-tap FIR feedforward reverb (delay taps at 21–105 ms, gain 0.40→0.07 per tap). Result
  reads back to CPU and plays looped. GPU timing displayed (typically 30–80ms — PCIe transfer

    FAL_KEY in use. Inspires `ghost-sfx`: generated naturalistic sounds for Ghost scenes +
    HRTF positioning. More immersive than `29-scene-spatial`.

  - **AI Harmonizer (§96, arxiv 2506.18143)** — 4-part diatonic harmony from solo melody.
    Not browser-deployable yet. Inspires `diatonic-harmony` (zero deps): mic → key detection →
    diatonic third + fifth voice generation. "Your melody; chord-correct harmonies alongside."
    **Build next cycle.**

  - **Token-Based Audio Inpainting (§97, arxiv 2507.08333)** — Discrete diffusion for
    coherent audio continuation. Potential upgrade for `43-stable-extend`. No API yet.

  - **iPlug3 2026 (§100)** — WebGPU + SDL3 + MCP agents; WASM browser output. Best path
    to "Resonance as a native installation."

  **Open questions for Karel**:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel env? → enables `claude-shader`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` still pending → `lyria-ghost`, `binaural-lyria`, `piano-to-ghost`

## Previous newest (Cycle 60)

- **[/dream/](/dream/)** — Dashboard. `demoable`
  The `/dream/` index page is now a full morning-review dashboard. The complete MORNING.md
  renders at the top — all four sections with proper markdown formatting. 3-cycle activity stream.
  Phone-first layout (`max-w-3xl`), dark theme. Zero deps, zero API. Build: 176 B.
  This was IDEAS.md §0 (`[queued, do FIRST]`), deferred 59 cycles.

## Previous newest (Cycle 59)

- **[/dream/50-tap-rhythm](/dream/50-tap-rhythm)** — Tap Rhythm. `demoable`
  The first prototype any non-musician can immediately use. Tap or clap a rhythm into the
  mic → onset detection measures your tempo → 32-step circular drum loop plays back in your
  detected BPM. Amplitude classifies drum type: gentle tap = kick (violet), medium = snare
  (cyan), hard/clap = hi-hat (amber). Clock-face display with rotating hand. Click any step
  to toggle. BPM slider. Demo mode (no permissions): 4-on-the-floor preset loads instantly.
  Drum synthesis: Web Audio only — kick = sine frequency glide, snare = bandpass noise,
  hat = highpass noise. **Live-performance fit**: tap a groove at a venue, loop starts in 2s.
  Zero deps, zero API. Build: 5.13 kB.

## Previous newest (Cycle 58)

- **[/dream/49-anemone-av](/dream/49-anemone-av)** — Anemone AV.
  A bioluminescent sea anemone dancing to audio. 14 tentacles in a forward-kinematics
  chain of 4 segments each — sub-bass sways the trunk, low-mids ripple branches,
  treble pulses the glowing violet tip beads. Percussive hits cause a full-body flash
  (all tips scale 1.4× for ~200ms). Drag to orbit. Strong bloom makes the form glow
  against pure black. Zero new deps — all Three.js packages were already installed.
  Demo mode: 6 incommensurable LFOs animate the form without mic permissions.

  **Why this is different from `21-three-mesh-av`**: the icosahedron is mathematical
  geometry that deforms. The anemone is a *living form* — flexible tentacles with FK
  amplification (tips move 2.8× the root), staggered phases so they ripple around the
  ring, bioluminescent color grading from cyan at the base to violet at the tips.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/49-anemone-av/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 57)

- **[/dream/48-arc-compose](/dream/48-arc-compose)** — Arc Compose.
  Write a Resonance journey arc using structural section tags, hear MiniMax Music 2.6 generate a
  60–90s AI piece that follows that exact structure.

  **Left panel**: A textarea pre-loaded with a four-section cinematic arc (`[Intro]` single piano
  in vast reverb / `[Build Up]` cello enters, tension / `[Chorus]` full orchestral peak / `[Outro]`
  piano alone, then silence). Eight section-tag buttons ([Intro], [Verse], [Pre-Chorus], [Build Up],
  [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro], [Inst]) append directly to the arc. Style/genre field below.

  **Right panel**: Six-band radial bloom visualizer (same palette as `1-live`) during playback.
  Waveform strip with cyan playhead sweep. Replay from cache (no re-generation). Download MP3.

  **Why this is different**: `6-compose` sends a text description → music, with no structural
  control. `arc-compose` uses section tags as first-class parameters: `[Intro] → [Build Up] →
  [Chorus] → [Outro]` shapes the arc of the generated piece. This is the `18-elevenlabs-compose`
  idea (38 cycles in the queue) finally buildable at $0.03 instead of $1.13.

  ⚠ **API note**: Endpoint `fal-ai/minimax/music-01` and parameters from fal.ai naming conventions.
  If the prototype shows an error, paste the raw message and the agent fixes it next cycle.

## Previous newest (Cycle 56 — research)

- **Cycle 56 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 8 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§85–92).
  4 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **Google Flow Music + Lyria 3 Pro (§85)** — Stem Splitter extracts drums/bass/piano from any
    AI track. 3-minute structured songs. "Replace + Extend" for section regeneration. Same Gemini
    key as `lyria-ghost`. Inspires `stem-spatial`.

  - **MiniMax Music 2.6 (§86)** — 14+ structural section tags on fal.ai at $0.03/generation.
    FAL_KEY already in use. Inspires `arc-compose` — the `18-elevenlabs-compose` idea at 37×
    lower cost.

  - **`anemone-av` (§92)** — Organic bioluminescent 3D form, Three.js TSL. All deps already
    installed. Zero new packages. High visual impact. One-cycle build.

  - **`tap-rhythm` (§89)** — Tap onset detection → circular step sequencer → Karplus-Strong
    drum synthesis. Zero deps, zero API. Highest accessibility.

  **Open questions for Karel**:
  - GEMINI_API_KEY → unlocks `lyria-ghost`, `binaural-lyria`, `piano-to-ghost`, `stem-spatial`
  - FAL_KEY already in use → `arc-compose` built this cycle

## Previous newest (Cycle 55)

- **[/dream/47-mood-journey](/dream/47-mood-journey)** — Mood Journey.
  Click your **NOW** mood on the Russell circumplex (valence × arousal), then click your **GOAL**
  mood, pick a duration (Quick 2m / Short 5m / Normal 10m / Deep 20m), and press **▶ Begin journey**.
  The dot glides from Now to Goal automatically — no interaction needed. The music walks with it.

  **Two simultaneous audio layers both track the gliding position**:
  - Mood synthesis (from `38-mood-xy`): BPM, chord quality, register, attack, arpeggio, filter brightness
  - Isochronic tones (from `42-binaural`): β 16Hz / α 10Hz / θ 6Hz / δ 2Hz matching arousal level

  Canvas shows a quadrant color wash (amber=energetic+happy, purple=energetic+sad, teal=calm+happy,
  navy=calm+sad), a blue trail of the positions visited, a dashed green path to the goal, and a
  glowing dot at the current position. Noise layer (pink/brown) available mid-journey.

  **"Surrender control to the arc."** The first prototype that auto-generates a complete emotional
  trajectory rather than responding to manual input. Based on the proactive music therapy research
  cluster (RESEARCH.md §84). Zero deps, no API keys.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/47-mood-journey/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 54)

- **[/dream/46-osc-composer](/dream/46-osc-composer)** — Oscilloscope Composer.
  Design a Lissajous figure using three sliders (L freq, R freq, phase), then download the
  **stereo WAV that draws it** on an oscilloscope in XY mode. Five preset shapes map to musical
  intervals: Circle (1:1 unison), Figure-8 (1:2 octave), Trefoil (2:3 perfect fifth), Rose
  (3:4 perfect fourth), Starburst (3:5 major sixth). Puzzle mode shows a target figure alongside
  yours — tune to match and collect the "✓ Matched!" badge.

  **The only prototype where the download IS the point** — the WAV's L channel is the X axis
  and R channel is the Y axis. Load it in `20-scope` (Phase Portrait mode) and the figure
  reappears. Load it on a real oscilloscope and it draws on screen.

  **Musical intervals as geometry**: a perfect fifth is a 2:3 frequency ratio — which draws
  a three-lobe trefoil. A perfect fourth draws a four-lobe rose. The visual shape IS the
  harmonic relationship. Zero deps, no API keys.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/46-osc-composer/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 53)

- **[/dream/45-guided-session](/dream/45-guided-session)** — Guided Brainwave Session.
  Pick a journey ("Stressed → Calm", "Scattered → Calm", "Wired → Drowsy", "Alert → Deep Rest"),
  set a step duration (Quick 30s / Normal 5m / Deep 10m), and press **Begin journey**. Isochronic
  tones walk your brainwave frequency from the starting state to the goal state — no headphones
  required (works with any speaker).

  Each step plays isochronic tones (amplitude-modulated carrier at 200 Hz) at the target frequency,
  then smoothly sweeps to the next waypoint with a 4-second time constant. At β⁺ 24Hz: tight
  staccato rings. By α 10Hz: gentle ripples. By θ 4Hz: three-second expanding pulses. The canvas
  slows visibly as the journey descends — the rings are a clock of the session's progress.

  **Path breadcrumb** shows each waypoint with the current one highlighted. **Progress bar** per
  step with timer. **"→ next"** button available after 50% of step duration (sink faster if you
  want). **Auto-advance** after the full duration. **Noise layer** (pink for β/α, brown for θ/δ)
  auto-switches on each step. **Journal textarea** (same localStorage pattern as `42-binaural`).
  **Session summary** on completion showing time per waypoint.

  **First Resonance prototype that is a genuine wellness tool** — based on the proactive music
  therapy research cluster (RESEARCH.md §§74, 75, 80). Descending-frequency arcs validated by
  three Frontiers 2026 papers. Zero deps; no API keys needed.

## Previous newest (Cycle 52)

- **[/dream/44-vocal-bgm](/dream/44-vocal-bgm)** — Vocal BGM.
  Record 5–15 seconds of humming, singing, or piano. Pick an arrangement style (jazz trio /
  ambient / cinematic / rock / folk). Click **Arrange →**. ACE-Step 1.5 on fal.ai receives
  your recording and generates a 30-second full-band arrangement where your melodic contour
  is the lead motif — the AI adds drums, bass, chords, and harmony beneath your melody.

  **Different from `43-stable-extend`**: stable-extend continues your recording *forward*
  in time. vocal-bgm wraps a full band *around* your phrase — your melody stays as the
  primary voice. Think of it as "here's the tune, now play it for me as a jazz trio."

  Genre selector shows the full tag string sent to ACE-Step (e.g. "jazz piano trio, warm,
  acoustic, 70 BPM, upright bass, brush drums") so the model's inputs are legible.
  `[inst]` lyrics tag prevents the model from adding AI vocals on top of your humming.
  Waveform strip: **amber** (your melody) | **blue** (full arrangement).
  Bloom visualizer during playback (same six-band palette as `1-live`).

  ⚠ **API note**: endpoint `fal-ai/ace-step/audio-to-audio` from RESEARCH.md §77. If the
  prototype shows an error, the raw message is displayed — paste it and we'll fix in the
  next cycle.

  **$0.006/arrangement. FAL_KEY already in use.**

## Previous newest (Cycle 49)

- **[/dream/43-stable-extend](/dream/43-stable-extend)** — Stable Extend.
  Record a piano phrase (up to 30s), click **Extend →**, wait ~10–30s. Stable Audio 2.5 on fal.ai
  receives your actual audio and generates a seamless 30-second continuation in the same style and
  mood. The extended track auto-plays through the six-band radial bloom visualizer (same palette as
  `1-live`). Waveform strip shows your recording in **amber** (left) and the AI extension in **blue**
  (right), split by a divider line so you can see both clips at a glance.
  Style prompt guides the extension: "continue as a cello duet", "jazz register", "ambient fade".
  The server route at `/dream/43-stable-extend/api` handles the fal.ai call server-side — FAL_KEY
  is never exposed to the browser. **$0.20/generation. FAL_KEY already in use.**
  **First prototype where AI extends YOUR recording** (not a text-prompt generation, not style-match
  — a direct continuation of the actual audio in latent space).

  ⚠ **API note**: endpoint `fal-ai/stable-audio-25/inpaint` sourced from RESEARCH.md §70. If the
  prototype shows an API error, the raw error message is displayed — tell me the correct endpoint
  and parameters if fal.ai uses different names.

## Previous newest (Cycle 48 — research)

- **Cycle 48 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 8 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§69–76).
  4 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **Lyria 3** (Google DeepMind, Feb 2026) — Gemini API music generation with **image input**.
    Send a Ghost scene image → receive a 30s ambient MP3 shaped by that visual's mood. Same
    Gemini API key as `30-lyria-jam`. Prototype: `lyria-ghost`. Admin-only. Free tier.

  - **Stable Audio 2.5** (Stability AI, 2026) — fal.ai audio continuation at **$0.20/audio**.
    Record a piano phrase → AI extends it seamlessly into a 30s track. Open source. FAL_KEY
    already in use. Prototype: `stable-extend`. One-cycle build, no new approvals needed.

  - **`binaural-lyria`** — Upgrade of `42-binaural`: binaural beats at the target brainwave
    frequency + Lyria 3 generates ambient music tuned to that same state (delta=vast drones,
    alpha=calm piano, gamma=bright gamelan). Meditation + AI music closed loop. Needs Gemini key.

  - **`piano-to-ghost`** — Play piano → mic chord detection + emotion coordinates → Lyria 3
    generates Ghost-themed music + Ghost LoRA generates a matching image simultaneously. All of
    the dream zone's systems unified. Needs GEMINI_API_KEY + FAL_KEY. Complex.

  - **Music as "controlled hallucination"** (Frontiers, 2026) — The brain simulates a "virtual
    body" inside music via active interoceptive inference. Validates Resonance's "transcendent
    listening" thesis scientifically. The binaural beat prototype (`42-binaural`) is already one
    of the most direct implementations of this effect.

  - **ONNX Runtime Web 1.26.0** — WebGPU EP default. `neural-pitch` CREPE-tiny would now run
    at ~1ms/frame inference. Raises urgency of asking Karel about CDN ONNX dep.

  - **Open questions for Karel**:
    - GEMINI_API_KEY → enables `lyria-ghost`, `binaural-lyria`, `30-lyria-jam`, `piano-to-ghost`
    - CDN ONNX dep (~2MB) OK? → enables `neural-pitch` upgrade at near-zero latency (v1.26 WebGPU)
    - FAL_KEY already in use → `stable-extend` buildable immediately next cycle

## Previous newest (Cycle 47)

- **[/dream/42-binaural](/dream/42-binaural)** — Binaural Beat Synthesizer.
  Two pure sine waves — one per ear — with a precise frequency difference the brain perceives
  as a beat at that difference frequency. The beat has no physical existence in the air; it's
  neurological. This is called the *frequency following response*, and it's the closest thing
  to "direct brain audio" in the Web Audio API.
  **Five brainwave states**: δ (0.5–4 Hz, deep violet) · θ (4–8 Hz, indigo, meditative) ·
  α (8–13 Hz, cyan, relaxed — default) · β (13–30 Hz, green, focused) · γ (30+ Hz, amber,
  high cognition). The canvas color shifts with the state; the ring expansion speed matches
  the beat frequency. At δ 2 Hz: two slow tidal pulses per second. At γ 40 Hz: rings blur into
  constant shimmering amber glow (appropriate — gamma is continuous, not discrete beats).
  **Two modes**: *binaural* (headphones required — two separate ear tones) vs *isochronic*
  (speakers OK — amplitude modulated carrier, audible as tremolo). Five presets. Live carrier
  and beat frequency sliders update the oscillators without restarting.
  **The second psychoacoustics prototype** (after `40-shepard-tone`): both explore the gap
  between what is physically present in the sound and what the brain perceives.
  **"A tone that doesn't exist — until you listen to it."** Zero deps; pure Web Audio API.

## Previous newest (Cycle 46)

- **[/dream/41-code-vis](/dream/41-code-vis)** — Code Vis.
  A split-screen live coding environment: textarea DSL on the left, glowing canvas on the right.
  Each line of code is a synthesizer voice: `C4 tri 0.8` → a triangle-wave oscillator at C4 at
  amplitude 0.8. Edit the score; 400ms later the audio crossfades and the canvas updates.
  **Visual**: N voices arranged in an N-gon (triangle for a triad, square for a tetrad). Each ring
  glows in the `1-live` frequency hue (violet=bass, red=treble) and pulses at the BPM rate with a
  heartbeat sin² envelope. The circular constellation reads as a chord diagram: the pitch structure
  IS the shape. Default: C major triad → three differently-colored rings in a triangle.
  **DSL syntax**: `NOTE WAVE AMP` (e.g. `F#3 saw 0.4`, `Bb2 tri 0.7`, `A5 sin 0.3`).
  Waves: `sin tri saw sq`. BPM slider changes pulse rate live. ↓ PNG saves a frame.
  **"Write a chord in 10 seconds. Hear it. See it."** Zero deps; pure Web Audio + Canvas2D.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/41-code-vis/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 45)

- **[/dream/40-shepard-tone](/dream/40-shepard-tone)** — Shepard Tone.
  An endless musical staircase. The tone rises forever — and never arrives.
  8 sine oscillators (A1–A8), each gaining a bell-curve amplitude that peaks at A4 (440Hz) and
  fades to near-silence at the extremes. As all oscillators glide upward together, the loud middle
  tones always seem to be rising — but when A8 fades and the wrapped A1 re-enters, the transition
  is inaudible because both extremes are below the consciousness threshold.
  **Controls**: Rate slider (0.5–30 BPM = octaves/min); Ascending/Descending toggle; Glide/Whole-tone/
  Semitone interval modes (each gives a different temporal rhythm to the illusion); Freeze (suspends
  the glide, revealing the chord); Mic mode (louder playing → faster ascent).
  **Visual**: a rotating logarithmic spiral (the helical pitch model — chromatic height × register);
  a glowing dot tracks the current phase position. Oscillator column (right): each of the 8 circles
  glows proportional to its current gain — bright at center (A3–A5), dim at extremes (A1, A8).
  The glow sweeps upward then silently resets from the bottom. The visual IS the illusion.
  **"The first prototype about the gap between physical sound and perceived sound."**
  First psychoacoustics prototype in the sandbox. Zero deps; pure Web Audio oscillators.

## Previous newest (Cycle 44 — research)

- **Cycle 44 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 8 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§61–68).
  3 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **`neural-pitch`** (shared upgrade, needs Karel OK) — CREPE-tiny ONNX neural pitch detector
    (~2MB CDN, no package.json change). 10× more accurate than autocorrelation on complex piano,
    voice, reverb. Would upgrade `13-piano-canvas`, `24-piano-roll`, `26-score-follow`,
    `33-aria-companion`, `37-ratio-lab`, `39-anticipate` in one shared hook change.

  - **Magenta RealTime** (open-weights Apache 2.0) — embedding arithmetic style blending.
    `0.7 × jazz + 0.3 × ambient` is a mathematically valid vector blend. Upgrades `30-lyria-jam`
    spec: 2D style canvas (like `38-mood-xy`) > sliders. Navigate music style as a 2D landscape.

  - **Mirelo AI SFX (new on fal.ai)** — Audio Extension + Audio Inpainting. Extend Ghost
    soundscapes from 10s clips into 60s looping scenes. Needs FAL_KEY. See RESEARCH.md §63.

  - **Transformers.js v4** — 53% smaller bundles, 200ms model load (was 2s). CREPE-tiny and
    MusicGen-small both significantly more viable for browser-native ML inference.

  **Open questions for Karel**:
  - CDN ONNX dep (~2MB) OK for `neural-pitch` upgrade?
  - Gemini key still pending for `30-lyria-jam`.
  - Suno API + stems endpoint for `suno-spatial`?

## Previous newest (Cycle 43)

- **[/dream/39-anticipate](/dream/39-anticipate)** — Aria Anticipate.
  Extends `33-aria-companion` with ReaLJam-style ghost-note anticipation. After you play a phrase
  and pause, Aria's entire planned response appears as **dashed blue outlines** in the ARIA panel —
  all notes at once, before a single note sounds. You see the full melodic shape of the response
  in silence. Then each note solidifies with a bright flash as it sounds, left to right.
  The canvas uses a split past/future time window: user notes scroll left, Aria's ghost notes
  sit to the right of the center "now" line and sweep left to meet it as they play.
  **"Watch Aria decide before she plays."** Inspired by ReaLJam (CHI 2025): showing AI intention
  before execution was the single highest-rated design feature in human-AI piano experiments.
  Zero deps; pure Web Audio + Canvas2D.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/39-anticipate/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 42)

- **[/dream/38-mood-xy](/dream/38-mood-xy)** — Mood XY.
  The Russell circumplex model as a musical instrument. A 2D canvas: X = valence (sad ← happy),
  Y = arousal (calm ↕ energetic). Drag the dot anywhere. The synthesizer follows in real time:
  **arousal** controls BPM (40–140), voice count (1–4), register (C3–C5), attack (0.8s→0.04s),
  and whether chords arpeggiate or sound simultaneously. **Valence** controls chord quality
  (major / minor / dim), filter brightness (400–5000 Hz), and note sustain length (+40% longer
  when sad). Background color shifts with quadrant: amber (excited+happy) → purple (excited+sad)
  → teal (calm+happy) → navy (calm+sad). Pastel trail shows your path.
  **Four immediately distinct sounds**: drag to top-right (bright major arpeggios, 120 BPM) ·
  top-left (dark diminished runs, 110 BPM) · bottom-right (sustained major pads, 55 BPM) ·
  bottom-left (sparse minor chords, 40 BPM).
  **The first prototype where audio is generated FROM emotional coordinates, not analyzed from
  audio input.** "Navigate your musical mood." Zero deps; pure Web Audio + Canvas2D.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/38-mood-xy/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 41)

- **[/dream/37-ratio-lab](/dream/37-ratio-lab)** — Ratio Lab.
  A 9×5 Tonnetz lattice: each node is a just-intonation ratio relative to A3 (220 Hz drone).
  **Right = P5 (×3/2). Up = M3 (×5/4). Diagonal = m3 (×6/5).** Click any node to hear it
  against the drone — consonant intervals feel "locked in," no beating. Multiple nodes ring
  simultaneously. Hover for JI ratio + Hz + cents deviation from equal temperament.
  Color encodes consonance: **amber/warm (simple ratio, large)** → **cool blue (complex, small)**.
  Mic mode: autocorrelation pitch detection highlights the nearest lattice node with a pulsing
  blue ring. Hold a chord on piano — multiple nodes glow and their triangle shape on the lattice
  IS the chord quality (major = one orientation, minor = inverted).
  **The first prototype about tuning theory.** "Navigate harmony as a landscape."
  Zero deps; pure Web Audio + Canvas2D.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/37-ratio-lab/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 40)

- **[/dream/36-pluck-field](/dream/36-pluck-field)** — Pluck Field.
  24 Karplus-Strong virtual strings in a 4×6 grid: C pentatonic from C2 to G6. Click any
  cell to pluck — the string vibrates as an animated standing wave and rings with synthesized
  plucked-string audio (no oscillators, no samples: feedback delay loop IS the string). The
  first prototype built on **physical modeling synthesis**. Low strings ring for ~3 seconds;
  high strings decay in ~0.5s — all from the physics. Hold multiple cells to hear chords bloom.
  **Touch/drag = glissando** (sweep your finger across cells like a harp).
  Mic mode: percussion onsets pluck random strings in the octave range matching your centroid.
  Color: violet (C2) → orange (G6), same palette as `1-live`.
  **"What if the canvas was a harp?"** Zero deps; pure Web Audio API.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/36-pluck-field/README.md`

## Previous newest (Cycle 39 — research)

- **Cycle 39 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 8 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§53–60).
  5 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **`36-pluck-field`** (build next) — Karplus-Strong virtual string field. Click canvas cells
    to pluck 24 tuned virtual strings (C pentatonic, 4 octaves). Each string = 3 Web Audio nodes
    (`DelayNode` feedback loop). Physical modeling synthesis — none of the 35 existing prototypes
    use it. "What if the canvas was a harp?" Zero deps, one cycle.

  - **`37-ratio-lab`** (build next) — Tonnetz just intonation lattice explorer. Click any ratio
    node to hear the just-intonation interval against a drone. Mic mode shows where your pitch
    falls on the lattice. First tuning-theory prototype in the sandbox. High surprise value.
    Inspired by LIMITER (arxiv 2507.08675).

  - **`38-mood-xy`** — Russell circumplex emotion synthesis. Drag a dot on a 2D valence×arousal
    plane; Web Audio synthesizes music in real time (tempo, chord quality, register, brightness
    all driven by coordinates). First prototype where audio is *output* from emotional coordinates,
    not *input*. Inspired by AffectMachine-Pop (arxiv 2506.08200).

  - **`39-anticipate`** — ReaLJam-inspired ghost-note anticipation display. Extends
    `33-aria-companion`: AI's planned response notes appear as ghost bars before they play.
    "Watch Aria decide before she plays." Inspired by ReaLJam (arxiv 2502.21267, CHI 2025).

  - **`40-browser-musicgen`** — In-browser MusicGen via Transformers.js (~390MB ONNX model,
    cached after first load, zero API cost). Potential path for the long-queued `6-compose`.
    Needs Karel OK on model download size.

  - **Open question for Karel**: OK on ~390MB Transformers.js model download for in-browser
    AI music generation? Also: Gemini key for `lyria-jam`? MediaPipe CDN for `gesture-music`?

## Previous newest (Cycle 38)

- **[/dream/35-loop-station](/dream/35-loop-station)** — Loop Station.
  The first prototype where you **build** a composition rather than react to one. Four
  phase-locked recording slots: tap **● REC** to record from mic, **■ STOP** to close the
  loop — it starts playing immediately, locked to the same grid as all other slots. MUTE,
  CLEAR, and 1/2/4-bar length selectors per slot. BPM tap-tempo button.
  Demo loads 4 pre-synthesized loops (sub-bass drone, piano phrase, arpeggio, click track)
  all phase-locked at 80 BPM — try ▶ Load demo loops for an immediate layered result.
  Canvas mini-waveform per slot with scrolling playhead. Color scheme matches `1-live`
  (violet=sub-bass, green=low-mid, orange=high-mid, yellow=mid).
  **"Build a multi-layer performance in real time."** Zero deps; pure Web Audio API.

## Previous newest (Cycle 37)

- **[/dream/34-spectral-morph](/dream/34-spectral-morph)** — Spectral Morph.
  The first prototype to **resynthesize** rather than visualize. Two audio sources (A and B)
  are FFT'd every 256 samples by an inline AudioWorklet (1024-point Cooley-Tukey, hand-rolled).
  The morph slider blends their magnitude spectra in the frequency domain, then IFFTs back to
  audio with Source A's phase. At t=0.5 you hear a genuinely new timbre — not a crossfade.
  Demo: sawtooth (many harmonics) → sine (one harmonic). Best: try Source B = **noise** —
  the saw-to-noise cross-dissolve is something a crossfade can never produce.
  Visual: three stacked spectrum strips (B top, Blend middle, A bottom); vertical cursor shows
  morph position live.
  **"Morph between your piano and a sawtooth — through the spectrum, not a mixer."**
  Zero deps; pure Web Audio + inline FFT worklet.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/34-spectral-morph/README.md`

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 36)

- **[/dream/33-aria-companion](/dream/33-aria-companion)** — Aria Companion.
  The first **dialogue** prototype in the sandbox — all 32 previous prototypes are reactive;
  this one listens, waits, and responds. Play a melody on piano or sing; after 2 seconds of
  silence, Aria generates a response phrase using a Markov chain learned from your own note
  transitions. The longer you play, the more Aria mirrors your interval tendencies.
  Visual: split dual piano roll — YOU (warm orange, top) + ARIA (cool blue, bottom).
  **"The piano responds when you rest."** Zero deps; no ML. ~20 lines of Markov JS.

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/33-aria-companion/README.md`

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 35 — research)

- **Cycle 35 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 9 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§44–52).
  3 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **`aria-companion`** (build next) — turn-taking piano dialogue agent. User plays a phrase;
    after 2s of silence the system generates a Markov-chain response and plays it back as a piano
    sound. "The piano responds when you rest." First **dialogue** prototype in the sandbox (all
    32 previous are *reactive*, not compositional). Inspired by Aria-Duet, NeurIPS 2025.
    Zero deps, one cycle.

  - **`spectral-morph`** — AudioWorklet FFT magnitude interpolation. Morph slider blends the
    spectral character of two audio sources → resynthesized output. Unique: first prototype to
    resynthesize from frequency-domain manipulation rather than just analyze it. Zero deps,
    one cycle.

  - **`loop-station`** — 4-slot BPM-synced live loop station. First prototype that lets you
    BUILD a multi-layer composition over time rather than playing/watching. Loop boundary
    crossfade eliminates clicks. Demo pre-loads 4 loops. Performance-relevant. Zero deps,
    one cycle.

  - **Design Space for Live Music Agents** (arxiv 2602.05064, Feb 2026): taxonomy of 184 live
    music systems. Key insight: "dialogue agents" (listen → compose → respond) are the
    least-explored category, and the sandbox has zero. `aria-companion` fills this gap.

  - **Web Audio API — Configurable Render Quantum** (Q4 2026 spec): buffer size below 128 samples
    → sub-3ms audio latency. Will improve all real-time pitch-detection prototypes once shipped.

  - **iPlug3** (Jan 2026): WebGPU + SDL3 + MCP audio plugin framework — scripts mirror web APIs.
    **Best current path to "Resonance as an installation"** (Tauri mode, venue deployment).

  - **Kling 2.6**: Ghost image + motion prompt → 5s cinematic clip + native audio, $0.14/sec.
    New option for ghost-animate (alongside HappyHorse, Veo 3.1 Fast). Speech synthesis: the
    Ghost can say a line from the journey narrative in the clip. Admin-only, needs FAL_KEY.

  **Open questions for Karel**:
  - Gemini API key still needed for `30-lyria-jam` (infinite steering AI music).
  - CDN dep (~8MB) still pending for `31-gesture-music` (hand gesture → synth).
  - `iPlug3` — is the "Resonance as an installation" path worth a dedicated design cycle?

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 34)

- **[/dream/32-mood-vis](/dream/32-mood-vis)** — Mood Viz.
  Audio features (energy, spectral brightness, band coefficient of variation) drive a rule-based
  classifier that picks one of six visual modes automatically — and transitions between them as
  the music changes character. Six moods → six aesthetics: Lissajous (minimal/silence), ink rings
  (calm+bright), orbital drift (calm+dark), radial bloom (energetic+bright), pulse field
  (energetic+dark), spectral mandala (complex). 7% trail persistence gives natural ~1s crossfades.
  Demo cycles through all six moods at 5s each without a mic. HUD shows current mood + amplitude,
  centroid, spread in real time. **"The visualizer that listens — and decides."**

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/32-mood-vis/README.md`

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 33)

- **[/dream/29-scene-spatial](/dream/29-scene-spatial)** — Scene Spatial.
  Six Ghost narrative scenes (Stone Chamber → Cosmic Ascension), each with a hand-authored 3D
  soundscape built from oscillators, filtered noise, and FM chirps — no audio files. Sources
  placed on a sphere via Web Audio HRTF PannerNode. Drag any colored dot to reposition a sound
  source in real time; the HRTF updates instantly. Canvas shows top-down sphere view (F/B/L/R
  compass; ▲/▼ for elevation). Reverb from a per-scene procedurally generated impulse response.
  **"Each Ghost scene has a sound as distinctive as its visuals — wear headphones."**
  Best demo: Forest Dawn (canopy birds above, stream left, piano right — three distinct azimuths).

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/29-scene-spatial/README.md`

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 32)

- **[/dream/28-chord-canvas](/dream/28-chord-canvas)** — Chord Canvas.
  Play a chord on piano (or mic any pitched source) — the chord name appears in huge monospace
  type: "Dm", "G", "C". Hue is the root note (C=red, D=yellow, G=blue, A=violet). A scrolling
  timeline strip below shows your chord history as colored blocks; wider = held longer. A 12-bar
  chromagram shows pitch-class energy in real time. Demo mode plays ii–V–I (Dm7→G7→Cmaj7) with
  audible triangle oscillators — you hear the chords as the detector names them.
  **"The first prototype to explicitly name musical structure."**
  Natural complement to `24-piano-roll` (pitch positions) and `22-code-score` (written notation).

  Design notes: `src/app/dream/28-chord-canvas/README.md`

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 31 — research)

- **Cycle 31 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 7 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§37–43).
  5 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **Lyria RealTime API** — WebSocket infinite streaming AI music with live text prompt blending
    (Google DeepMind). Browser-callable with a Gemini API key. `30-lyria-jam` prototype queued.
    Most live-performance-relevant AI music capability found yet: it never stops, you just steer it.
    **Open question for Karel: do you have a Gemini API key to test this with?**

  - **iOS 26 / Safari 26** — WebGPU now fully supported on iPhone/iPad. Karel's phone can now run
    `15-webgpu-fluid`, `16-particle-life-gpu`, and upcoming `27-gpu-additive`. No more mobile WebGPU
    disclaimer needed.

  - **`28-chord-canvas`** (build next) — chroma-based chord detection + color timeline. "F♯m, C, G"
    in real time. Zero deps, one-cycle build. First prototype to name musical structure.

  - **`29-scene-spatial`** (build next) — Ghost preset scenes as hand-authored 3D spatial audio
    environments. Stone chamber = dry reverb + stone percussion. Cosmic = vast reverberant pad.
    Zero deps, extends `7-spatial`'s HRTF. One-cycle build.

  - **`31-gesture-music`** — webcam hand gestures → synth (needs MediaPipe CDN dep, ~8MB).
    **Open question for Karel: OK to load MediaPipe from CDN?**

  - **`32-mood-vis`** — semantic "visualizer that listens" — adapts visual mode based on music
    character (calm/energetic/complex) via rule-based audio feature classifier. Zero deps.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 30)

- **[/dream/26-score-follow](/dream/26-score-follow)** — Score Follow.
  Bach Invention No.1 displayed as a static piano roll. Play along on piano or sing —
  the score lights green as you match each note (±1.5 semitone tolerance). The cursor
  advances only when you play the right pitch; it pauses on silence, backs up one note
  after 1.5s of wrong-note playing (forgiveness mode). Yellow triangle at the cursor
  shows your detected pitch in real time. Demo mode plays the score and self-matches —
  cursor advances perfectly through all 35 notes.
  **"The first prototype where your playing is evaluated, not just visualized."**
  Natural partner to `24-piano-roll` (see what you played) and `22-code-score` (write
  the score). This one asks you to *reproduce* it.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 29)

- **[/dream/25-cellular](/dream/25-cellular)** — Cellular.
  Conway's Game of Life where each column of the grid is a musical pitch (C2 left → C5 right).
  Living cells trigger triangle-wave notes; the *shape* of a pattern IS its melody.
  Glider = a wandering 4-note motif that walks up and down the pitch axis. Pulsar = a strict
  3-tick rhythmic chord machine. Acorn/R-pentomino = methuselahs that evolve chaotically for
  hundreds of generations. Click/drag to paint cells; BPM slider (40–120). No mic needed.
  **"What if generative music was also life?"**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 28)

- **[/dream/24-piano-roll](/dream/24-piano-roll)** — Piano Roll.
  Play piano or sing — each note appears as a glowing colored bar scrolling left, placed at its
  MIDI pitch on a vertical axis (C2 bottom, C7 top). The exact representation every DAW uses,
  rendered live from mic input. Hue matches `1-live` and `13-piano-canvas` (low pitch = cool,
  high = warm). Piano key sidebar highlights the active key. BPM slider sets scroll speed.
  Demo mode plays Bach Invention No.1 silently and paints its own notes — the roll fills itself
  from the score in real time. **"What you played, as notation."**
  Completes the piano-representation triptych: `13-piano-canvas` (abstract painting),
  `22-code-score` (written score), `24-piano-roll` (scrolling notation).

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 27 — research)

- **Cycle 27 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 8 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§29–36).
  4 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md. Highlights:

  - **`24-piano-roll`** (build next) — live scrolling piano roll from mic pitch detection. Every
    DAW has one; this is the first in the dream sandbox. Companion to `13-piano-canvas` (abstract
    painting) and `22-code-score` (written notation). Zero deps, one-cycle build.
  - **`25-cellular`** — Conway's Game of Life as a musical instrument. Living cells trigger pitched
    notes; gliders make repeating loops, oscillators make rhythmic patterns. Completely different
    generative paradigm from all 23 existing prototypes. Inspired by CLAVIER-36.
  - **`26-score-follow`** — live score cursor: play the Bach fragment from `22-code-score` on your
    piano; the score highlights as you match notes. Autocorrelation pitch detection + symbol tracking.
  - **`27-gpu-additive`** — particles ARE Fourier partials; GPU physics IS the synthesizer. Most
    technically ambitious idea in the queue (2+ cycles). Requires WebGPU.
  - **Kling 3.0 update** — multi-shot storyboarding + native audio enables a *full Ghost journey arc*
    as a coherent video sequence (4 shots, character consistency, native audio). Better than
    HappyHorse for multi-shot arcs. Single-clip: HappyHorse still wins.
  - **WASM AudioWorklet** trend confirmed as 2026 standard for browser DSP. Could upgrade
    `23-pitch-harmonize` with WASM FFT vocoder, but needs Karel approval on the build-step approach.
  - **Score following research active** (arxiv 2505.05078, May 2026) — 174ms latency, browser-feasible.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 26)

- **[/dream/23-pitch-harmonize](/dream/23-pitch-harmonize)** — Pitch Harmonize.
  First prototype that **transforms** audio in real time. Mic → AudioWorklet ring-buffer
  pitch shifter → HRTF 3D position. Pick an interval (+4th, +5th, +8va, -8va), drag the
  harmony to any azimuth (−90° left ↔ +90° right). With headphones: you and your
  pitch-shifted copy float apart in space. Visual: **dual phase-portrait vectorscope** on
  one canvas — orange trail = dry, blue trail = harmony. At a fifth interval, the two
  ellipses tilt at different angles (the interval IS a geometric relationship between them).
  Zero npm deps; AudioWorklet loaded from inline Blob URL.
  **"Become your own accompanist."**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 25)

- **[/dream/22-code-score](/dream/22-code-score)** — Code Score.
  Write a melody in the textarea; press play. Each note sounds and simultaneously paints itself
  onto the canvas. Score DSL: `C5 E D5 E E5 E F5 E` (note + duration), `rest Q`, `[C4 E4 G4] Q`
  (chords), `// comments`. Durations: W H Q E S = whole → sixteenth. BPM slider (40–200).
  **Rising phrases arc upward, descending phrases drift down** — the melodic contour IS the
  stroke's shape. Chord tones stack as parallel colored bars above the root.
  Default demo: Bach Invention No.1 in C major (BWV 772). Save painting as PNG.
  **The reverse of `13-piano-canvas`** — instead of playing → painting, you write → both
  hear and see.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 24)

- **[/dream/21-three-mesh-av](/dream/21-three-mesh-av)** — Three.js Mesh AV.
  First prototype using Three.js + React Three Fiber. An icosahedron whose surface deforms
  live with audio — **bass expands the equatorial belt**, **treble pushes the polar caps**,
  organic noise breathes the surface at silence. Custom GLSL vertex shader with view-space
  Fresnel rim glow. Bloom post-processing from `@react-three/postprocessing` makes displaced
  vertices glow into soft halos. Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom. Demo mode (no mic) and mic mode.
  **21 prototypes, and this is the first to use Three.js** — it was sitting installed and unused
  for 20 cycles.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 23 — research)

- **Cycle 23 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 7 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§§22–28).
  3 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md: `three-mesh-av` (Three.js R3F + TSL audio-reactive 3D
  mesh, buildable next cycle, zero new deps), `code-score` (browser music DSL + canvas painter),
  `pitch-harmonize` (AudioWorklet phase vocoder harmony + HRTF + dual vectorscope). Ghost-animate
  plan updated: prefer HappyHorse-1.0 (new #1 ranked joint audio-video model) over Seedance 2.0.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 22)

- **[/dream/20-scope](/dream/20-scope)** — Vectorscope.
  Two modes: **Lissajous demo** (no permissions) plots two sine waves against each other —
  each musical ratio (octave, fifth, fourth, M3rd, m3rd) traces a distinct closed figure.
  The CRT phosphor persistence makes cusps glow bright and fast arcs dim, exactly like
  a real oscilloscope. **Phase portrait** (mic) plots the live signal against its own past
  at an adjustable delay — a single piano note makes an ellipse, a chord makes overlapping
  loops, percussion makes an explosive spray. Rainbow colors from direction-of-travel hue
  (atan2 of trajectory tangent). **The geometry of harmony — visible.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 21)

- **[/dream/19-cymatics](/dream/19-cymatics)** — Cymatics.
  Sand particles settling into Chladni figures — the geometric node line patterns of a
  vibrating plate. 2000 amber grains drift onto the exact curves where sound is stationary.
  Eight modes from simple (1,2) Ring to intricate (5,6) Snowflake. Additive blending makes
  the node lines glow bright against black. Demo auto-cycles every 4.5s; mic mode maps
  spectral centroid to mode; manual buttons always override. **The hidden geometry of
  frequency — what Resonance literally means.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 20)

- **[/dream/18-granular](/dream/18-granular)** — Granular Cloud.
  Your audio shattered into overlapping grains and reassembled as a glowing cloud. Each dot IS
  a grain playing: X = where in the recent audio buffer it was sampled from, Y = its pitch shift
  in cents. Hue encodes buffer age (blue = older audio, orange = most recent). Additive blending
  makes dense grain regions glow bright. Four sliders: density, pitch range, grain size, scatter.
  Demo mode (synthetic oscillators, no permissions) and mic mode. **First prototype that transforms
  rather than visualizes — the dots are the sound.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 19)

- **[/dream/17-acoustic-trail](/dream/17-acoustic-trail)** — Acoustic Trail 3D.
  Your audio mapped to its own coordinate space: spectral centroid → X, treble ratio → Y,
  bass energy → Z. Each frame leaves a glowing point; the trail accumulates into a 3D scatter
  cloud that is the acoustic fingerprint of the performance. Additive blending means dense regions
  (repeated acoustic patterns) glow brighter. Drag to rotate. Color = centroid warmth (indigo =
  dark/bassy → orange = bright/treble). Demo mode runs 6 LFO-modulated oscillators that trace a
  slow Lissajous path over 30 seconds. **First prototype where audio becomes its own geometry.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 17)

- **[/dream/16-particle-life-gpu](/dream/16-particle-life-gpu)** — Particle Life GPU.
  9,000 particles across 6 species simulated entirely on the GPU via WGSL compute shaders —
  10× the count of `/dream/8-particle-life` (CPU, 900). Tiled N-body reduces GPU bandwidth
  64×. Additive blending creates galaxy-cluster glow; dense cores bloom white-hot, tendrils
  spiral like galactic arms. Requires WebGPU. Same audio mapping: band energy → species
  turbulence, onset → matrix reshuffle. Demo mode shows periodic reshuffles automatically.
  **10× more particles. GPU-native emergent behavior.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 18 — research)

- **Cycle 18 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 6 new entries in RESEARCH.md (§16–§21).
  2 new prototype ideas added to IDEAS.md: `acoustic-trail` (3D spectral coordinate trail, buildable
  next cycle, zero deps) and `elevenlabs-compose` (streaming structured music with section control,
  needs budget approval). Ghost-animate entry updated to use Seedance 2.0 (native audio, one step).
  Strongest finding: ElevenLabs Music streaming + section control opens a genuinely different music
  generation path than MiniMax or ACE-Step.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 16)

- **[/dream/15-webgpu-fluid](/dream/15-webgpu-fluid)** — WebGPU Fluid.
  Navier-Stokes fluid simulation at 512×512 via WebGPU render pipelines — 16× the resolution of
  `/dream/3-fluid` (WebGL2, 128×128). Uses `rgba16float` ping-pong textures natively: no extension
  flags, no Safari workaround. Same audio mapping (bass→pressure pulse, treble→turbulence,
  centroid→dye color, onset→burst). Drag to stir. Requires WebGPU; clear error message otherwise.
  **Compare side-by-side with 3-fluid** — vortex clarity difference is visible immediately.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 15)

- **[/dream/14-typography](/dream/14-typography)** — Kinetic Typography.
  Six Resonance phrases — RESONANCE, SOUND INTO LIGHT, BODY OF MUSIC, EACH NOTE A WAVE,
  FREQUENCIES, OF BEING — cycle every 8 seconds. Each letter is a physical object assigned
  to a frequency band; bass hits scatter bass-colored letters, treble shimmer agitates
  the high-frequency ones. Spring dynamics assemble the phrase from scatter over ~1.5s.
  Demo mode runs synthetic LFO bands — immediate, no permissions. Mic input drives letter
  turbulence live. **First prototype where language itself is the visual material.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 14)

- **[/dream/13-piano-canvas](/dream/13-piano-canvas)** — Piano Canvas.
  Your improvisation becomes a painting. Mic input → autocorrelation pitch detection →
  each note leaves a glowing brush stroke on a persistent canvas. Pitch → hue (A4=0°,
  rotating ~60°/octave), loudness → weight (1.5–8 px), duration → length. Rising melodic
  lines arc upward; descending ones drift down. Strokes accumulate; save as PNG when done.
  Demo mode plays a silent wandering melody so the canvas paints itself automatically.
  **The first prototype where the session leaves a permanent visual artifact.**

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 13 — research)

- **Cycle 13 was a research sweep** (no new prototype). 7 new entries in RESEARCH.md,
  4 new prototype ideas in IDEAS.md. Highlights: `piano-canvas` (built Cycle 14),
  `reference-compose` (MiniMax Music 2.5 style-match, needs FAL_KEY), WebGPU desktop-universal.

---

## Previous newest (Cycle 12)

- **[/dream/12-tessellate](/dream/12-tessellate)** — Tessellate.
  A 40×28 grid of Truchet tiles whose topology rewires on every beat. Each tile is a
  quarter-arc in one of two orientations; adjacent arcs form long connected curves across
  the canvas. On a bass hit, 12% of tiles flip simultaneously — the curves disconnect and
  reconnect into entirely new paths in a flash of white. Between beats, bass energy drives
  a slower drizzle of individual tile flips. Two complementary arc colors (warm + cool)
  rotate through the spectrum; mids control saturation. Op-art aesthetic — the first
  tile-based geometric prototype in the sandbox.
  **Start demo** for immediate visuals (no permissions). **Start mic** for live audio response.
  **Reshuffle** button resets the grid topology.

---

## Previous (Cycle 11)

- **[/dream/11-terrain](/dream/11-terrain)** — Spectrogram Terrain.
  Your audio history becomes a 3D landscape: frequency on the X axis, time receding to the
  horizon on Z, amplitude as terrain height. 64 log-spaced frequency columns (30 Hz → 20 kHz),
  80 frames of time-history. Bass forms blue mountains; treble draws bright orange ridges.
  The newest frame is at your feet; the oldest fades to the horizon.
  **Start demo** for instant visuals (silent oscillators with LFO breathing). **Start mic**
  for live input — piano chords show as overtone-series ridgelines.

---

## Previous (Cycle 10)

- **[/dream/10-strange](/dream/10-strange)** — Strange Attractor + FM Synthesis.
  The Lorenz chaotic system traces a butterfly in 3D and simultaneously drives FM
  synthesis — you see **and** hear the same chaos evolve. x-position flips carrier
  pitch between low (left wing, cool blue) and high (right wing, warm orange). z-height
  shapes harmonic richness (pure sine at bottom, buzzy at top). Wing transitions are
  irregular, non-repeating melody notes — because they're deterministically chaotic.
  **Mic mode**: your volume reshapes σ, accelerating wing transitions.
  **Start demo** for instant visuals + audio (no permissions, no upload).

---

## Previous (Cycle 9)

- **[/dream/9-reaction-diffusion](/dream/9-reaction-diffusion)** — Gray-Scott
  Reaction Diffusion. Two virtual chemicals on a GPU grid create Turing patterns:
  coral, fingerprints, dividing spots, maze walls — emergent from diffusion rates
  alone. Bass raises the feed rate; treble raises the kill rate; percussive hits
  inject new seed colonies. Click the canvas to inject manually. 6 presets.
  **Start demo** for instant visuals (no permissions).

---

## Previous (Cycle 8)

- **[/dream/8-particle-life](/dream/8-particle-life)** — Particle Life. 900
  particles across 6 species governed by a random 6×6 attraction/repulsion matrix.
  Emergent flocking, predator-prey spirals, orbiting clusters — nobody programmed
  them. Audio energy injects velocity noise per species. Percussive onsets reshuffle
  the matrix mid-song. Matrix heatmap in the corner shows the current rules.
  **Start demo** for instant (no permissions). **Start mic** for live audio response.

---

## Previous (Cycle 7)

- **[/dream/7-spatial](/dream/7-spatial)** — Binaural HRTF Spatial Audio. Six
  frequency bands placed in 3-D space around you via Web Audio `PannerNode`
  (HRTF model). Default: bass front-left, treble above, sub-bass below. Drag
  any dot on the sphere to move that band. Three modes: Demo oscillators (instant),
  Mic, File upload. Wear headphones — the spatial illusion is real above ~2kHz.

---

## Previous (Cycle 6)

- **[/dream/5-arcs](/dream/5-arcs)** — Journey Arc Engine v2. Five arc types
  (Psychedelic / EDM Build-and-Drop / Cinematic / Ritual / Sleep Cycle), each
  with distinct phases, color palettes, particle behaviors, and intensity curves.
  Demo mode compresses to 60s. Phase timeline at the bottom lets you jump to any
  phase. Mic input drives particle intensity live. The right panel explains each
  arc's design rationale vs. the psychedelic baseline.

---

## Previous newest (Cycles 4–5)

- **[/dream/4-operator](/dream/4-operator)** — Operator Panel — two-pane
  live performance interface. Left: performer canvas (6 AV scenes). Right:
  scene picker, BPM tap, mic crowd-noise meter, MIDI detection. Keys 1–6
  trigger scenes; Space taps BPM. Dip-to-black transitions. MIDI notes
  C3–A3 trigger scenes via hardware.
- Cycle 4 was a research cycle (no new prototype). See RESEARCH.md for 8 findings.

- **[/dream/3-fluid](/dream/3-fluid)** — Fluid — real-time Navier-Stokes ink-in-water
  driven by audio. Bass pulses the center, treble stirs turbulence, pitch shifts dye color.
  Drag to stir manually. Ambient drift mode for no-mic use.
- Cycle 4 was a research cycle (no new prototype). See RESEARCH.md for 8 findings.

## Prototypes

### 50-tap-rhythm
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 59 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/50-tap-rhythm`. Click **▶ Demo** — the 4-on-the-floor pattern starts immediately
at 120 BPM: kick on every beat (violet), snare on 2 and 4 (cyan), hi-hats on 8th notes (amber).
The clock hand rotates, lighting up each active dot as it passes.

Click any dot on the clock face to toggle it on/off. Add a second kick on the "&" of beat 3
(step 18 counting from 0) by clicking that position. Remove a hi-hat. The pattern changes
immediately on the next pass of the hand.

Adjust the BPM slider — at 80 BPM the loop feels slow and heavy; at 144 it drives.

For **tap mode**: click **🎤 Tap your rhythm**, allow mic permissions. Tap a rhythm on your
desk or clap — aim for 8+ taps. Vary your pressure:
- **Gentle desk tap** = kick (violet pulse ring)
- **Firm desk tap** = snare (cyan pulse ring)
- **Hard slap or clap** = hi-hat (amber pulse ring)

After you stop for 2 seconds (with 8+ taps), the loop builds automatically. If you want to
commit earlier, click **▶ Build loop**. Your tapped rhythm becomes the circular clock.

Click **↩ Re-tap** to record a new rhythm without stopping playback. The new loop replaces
the old one as soon as you pause.

Design notes: `src/app/dream/50-tap-rhythm/README.md`

### 49-anemone-av
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 58 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/49-anemone-av`. Click **Demo mode** — the anemone appears immediately, swaying in a
slow organic pattern driven by 6 incommensurable LFOs. The form never repeats exactly because the
LFO rates (0.07–0.28 Hz) are chosen to be irrational multiples of each other.

Watch the 14 tentacles. They all sway in the same general direction as the sub-bass LFO builds
(slow 0.07 Hz sine), but each one is offset in phase. The result is a ripple wave around the ring —
like a sea anemone in a gentle current.

Watch the tip beads. They pulse independently of the trunk sway — a 10.5 Hz shimmer from the
high-mid LFO. The tips look like bioluminescent buds that respond to a higher-frequency stimulus
than the trunk.

For **mic mode**: click **Start mic** and allow permissions. Play a deep bass note on piano — you
should see the trunk sway amplitude increase significantly (sub-bass band drives the primary sway).
Play a high bright chord — the tip beads shimmer harder (high-mid band). Hit a percussive note
loudly — onset detection fires a brief flash where all tips scale up 1.4× simultaneously, then decay
over ~15 frames. The flash is fast enough to feel like a startle response.

Drag to orbit: the form looks different from above (looking down on the tentacle ring from above)
and from below (looking up into the illuminated underside of the body disc). From below, the cyan
glow of the body disc creates a halo over the tentacle roots.

### 48-arc-compose
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 57 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/48-arc-compose`. The default arc is pre-loaded:

```
[Intro] single piano note in vast reverb, long silence between phrases
[Build Up] low cello drone enters slowly, pad swells underneath, tension builds
[Chorus] full orchestral peak, bright major resolution, drums and strings
[Outro] instruments fade one by one, piano alone, then silence
```

Click **▶ Compose**. After 20–40 seconds, a 60–90s orchestral piece starts playing through
the radial bloom visualizer. The waveform strip fills in cyan as the playhead sweeps.

Try editing the arc before composing. Add `[Verse] melodic piano theme, strings enter softly`
between `[Intro]` and `[Build Up]`. Change `[Chorus]` to `[Chorus] dark minor peak, brass`.
Hear how the structure of the piece changes. Style field: try `"jazz piano trio, 90 BPM"` —
the same arc rendered in a completely different genre.

Click **▶ replay** after playback ends to re-hear without re-generating ($0.03 saved).
Click **↓ mp3** to download the generated piece.

### 47-mood-journey
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 55 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/47-mood-journey`. Read the instruction: "Click the canvas to place your NOW mood."
Click somewhere in the **top-left** (energetic + sad = distressed state). The yellow NOW dot
appears with the label "NOW." The instruction updates: "Click to place your GOAL mood."
Click the **bottom-right** (calm + happy = content/serene state). The green GOAL dot appears
with a dashed ring. Select **Short 5m** (or **Quick 2m** for an immediate demo). Click **▶ Begin journey**.

The music starts immediately in the distressed state: fast (110–130 BPM), diminished chords,
dull filter, high register, staccato arpeggios. The isochronic carrier begins pulsing at β 16Hz
(fast tremolo). Watch the glowing dot start moving toward the GOAL position — slowly, continuously.

After ~30 seconds (Quick mode) you'll hear the chord quality shift toward minor as valence moves
right. After ~60 seconds the BPM drops noticeably. The isochronic frequency transitions from β
to α (16Hz → 10Hz) at around the arousal midpoint — you hear the tremolo slow into a distinct
10-beat-per-second wobble. By the end of the journey the music is slow, sustained, warm major
chords with a low isochronic purr at 6Hz (θ boundary).

The blue trail accumulates as the dot moves — the path you've taken is visible as the journey
progresses. The green dashed path shows what remains.

Add noise mid-journey: click **brown** and drag the level slider to ~0.3 for low-arousal states.
The brown rumble reinforces the descending arc without masking the carrier.

For a real session: use **Normal 10m** or **Deep 20m** with headphones in a quiet room.

### 46-osc-composer
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 54 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/46-osc-composer`. Click **▶ Start** — the canvas initializes black. Click the
**Circle** preset: a perfect circle appears in cyan on the black canvas. Click **Figure-8**:
the circle stretches into the ∞ symbol. Click **Trefoil**: three interlocked loops.

Now try the sliders. With the **Trefoil** shape active (2:3, 0°), drag the Phase slider slowly
from 0° toward 90°. The three lobes rotate and redistribute — the shape stays a trefoil but
its orientation changes continuously. At 180° you're back to the same shape but mirrored.

Try **L freq = 3, R freq = 5** without a preset — you get the raw 3:5 Starburst. Now drag
Phase — the star rotates. At 36° it aligns to the canonical Starburst shape.

Click **↓ Download WAV**: a "Rendering…" state appears for ~40ms while 220,500 samples are
computed in JavaScript (two Math.sin loops). A 5-second stereo WAV downloads. To verify:
open `20-scope` in another tab, load the WAV into it (Phase Portrait mode) — you'll see the
exact figure from the canvas.

Click **🎯 Puzzle mode**: select "Trefoil" as the target. The canvas splits — grey target on
left, yours on right. Set L=2, R=3 first to get the right shape, then sweep Phase until
"✓ Matched!" appears. The tolerance is 12° — just enough to require real tuning.

### 45-guided-session
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 53 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/45-guided-session`. Click **Scattered → Calm** (broadest descent: γ → β → α). Set
**Quick 30s** first — this gives you a 90-second demo session. Click **▶ Begin journey**.

The canvas starts showing rapid rings at 35 Hz (γ). Press the speaker volume up slightly — isochronic
tones are subtle. After 30 seconds the step auto-advances: the LFO frequency sweeps from 35Hz down to
18Hz over 8–10 seconds (you can hear the beat character slow). The rings spread further apart. At the
third step (α 10Hz), the rings are wide and slow — two to three seconds between each ring birth.

After the session completes, the summary shows time per waypoint and the journey name.

For a real session: try **Stressed → Calm** at **Normal (5m)** per step — 15 minutes total. Sit with
headphones or in a quiet room. The noise layer defaults to **pink** in β states and **brown** in θ/δ
states automatically. Open 📓 to write what you notice at each state — the note persists in localStorage.

**Speakers work** (no headphones required). The isochronic beat is the audible amplitude tremolo — at
β⁺ 24Hz it sounds like fast vibrato; at α 10Hz, rhythmic tremolo; at θ 4Hz, slow breathing pulses.

### 44-vocal-bgm
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 52 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/44-vocal-bgm`. Pick a genre (try **jazz trio** first). Click **● REC** and allow
mic permissions. Hum a melody — 5–10 seconds is ideal. One complete phrase with a clear shape
(ascending, descending, arc, call-and-response). Press **■ STOP**.

The amber waveform fills the left half of the strip — that's your melody. Click **Arrange →**.
The button shows "Arranging…" while ACE-Step works (~20–40s). When it returns, the blue waveform
fills the right half and playback starts automatically through the radial bloom.

The jazz trio arrangement will add upright bass and brush drums beneath your melody. Your hummed
line is the lead voice — the AI plays supporting role. Try the same melody with different genres:
cinematic strings gives it an orchestral sweep; ambient removes the drums and adds synth pads;
rock adds electric guitar and a full drum kit.

**Key insight**: this is different from `43-stable-extend`, which continues your phrase from the
end. vocal-bgm treats your whole phrase as the *theme* and arranges around it. The difference is
audible: in stable-extend the AI finishes your sentence; in vocal-bgm the AI plays backup for your
entire sentence at once.

Press **▶ replay** to re-listen without re-generating. Each generation costs $0.006.

### 43-stable-extend
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 49 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/43-stable-extend`. Press **● REC** and allow mic permissions. Play 5–15 seconds of
piano (or hum, sing, play any instrument). Press **■ STOP**. The amber waveform fills the left
half of the strip — that's your recording.

Type a style hint in the text field if desired ("continue as a string quartet", "jazz piano duet",
"ambient fade into silence"), then click **Extend →**. The button goes grey and shows "Extending…"
while the API call runs (~10–30s). When it returns, the blue waveform fills the right half and
playback starts automatically through the radial bloom visualizer. Press **▶ replay** to hear it
again without re-generating.

The bloom uses the same six-band color palette as `/dream/1-live` — the AI-generated music drives
the same visualization you'd see from live mic input. The loop closes: your phrase → AI continuation
→ your usual visualization.

⚠ If you see an API error in red, the raw fal.ai error text is shown. Tell the agent (next morning)
what it says and we'll fix the endpoint or parameters in `route.ts`.

### 42-binaural
**Status**: `polished` · **Cycle shipped**: 47 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-20

Open `/dream/42-binaural`. Click **▶ Start** with the default **α 10 Hz** preset and put on
headphones. You'll hear a single continuous tone — but inside your skull, a 10 Hz oscillation
begins. There's nothing at 10 Hz in the audio file; your superior olivary complex is computing
the difference between the 200 Hz (left ear) and 210 Hz (right ear) pure tones and producing a
synchronized neural beat.

The canvas shows cyan expanding rings at 10 Hz — one ring born per beat, growing to the canvas
edge and fading. The center glows on each ring birth. Try the **δ 2** preset: two slow deep-violet
pulses per second, like breathing. Let it run for 30 seconds; the rhythmic quality is visceral.

**Noise layer (new)**: Add brown noise while in δ or θ state — the low-frequency rumble
reinforces the carrier and masks distracting ambient sounds. Buttons: `off | pink | brown`.
Level slider controls the noise blend. Pink noise is airier (good for α/β). Brown noise is
deeper and more sleep-conducive (good for δ/θ). Both types remain transparent to the binaural beat.

**Session timer (new)**: After starting, a `α 0:00` counter appears and ticks up in real time.
Switch to θ — the counter resets to `θ 0:00` while the α time is banked. Switch back to α —
resumes from where you left off. Shows cumulative time in each state per session.

**Journal (new)**: Click `📓 session notes — alpha ↓` to expand a textarea. Each brainwave
state has its own persistent notes stored in `localStorage` (survives page reloads). The
placeholder prompts guide you toward the appropriate introspective mode:
- δ: "Note how your body feels..."
- α: "What do you notice in this moment?"
- γ: "What connections are you making?"
A `●` dot in the toggle label shows when saved text exists for the current state.

Try **γ 40**: the amber rings blur into a near-constant glow — you can't see 40 distinct rings at
60 fps. The carrier tones at 200 Hz and 240 Hz create a more complex audio texture; the binaural
beat is subconscious at this rate.

Switch to **isochronic** mode (stop first to switch): now the beat is audible as a tremolo
effect — the carrier amplitude pulses at the beat rate. At θ 6 Hz it sounds like a slow shiver.
Isochronic works on speakers; binaural requires headphones.

### 41-code-vis
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 46 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/41-code-vis`. Click **▶ Start** — C major chord rings immediately (three glowing
rings in a triangle: violet C4, green-yellow E4, amber G4). All three pulse together at 80 BPM.

Edit the textarea: change `E4 sin 0.6` to `Eb4 sin 0.6` — 400ms later, the middle ring shifts
color (slightly cooler) and you hear the chord go minor. Change `G4 tri 0.5` to `G5 tri 0.5` —
the third ring moves up the hue scale toward orange/red and becomes smaller (higher octave, same
amp, but G5 is in the treble range).

Add a fourth voice on a new line: `Bb4 saw 0.35` — the triangle becomes a square (four-voice
layout). The sawtooth ring is noticeably brighter/buzzier in the audio.

Try: `A2 sin 0.9` alone — one ring at the center, deep violet, large, slow pulse. BPM 40 for
meditative breathing. BPM 200 for a frenetic strobe.

Try a cluster: C4 / C#4 / D4 / D#4 four adjacent semitones — four rings in a square, tightly
spaced in hue. The beating between near-frequency oscillators creates interference patterns in
the audio; the visual looks like four closely-related siblings.

Click **↓ PNG** at the pulse peak to capture the bloom at its brightest.

### 40-shepard-tone
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 45 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/40-shepard-tone`. Click **▶ Start** — you'll immediately hear a tone that seems to
be rising. Let it run for 30 seconds. Notice: it never gets any higher. It just… keeps going up.

Try the Freeze button mid-glide: the tone suspends into a chord of 3–4 sine waves. You can hear
the bell-curve distribution — the middle notes (A3–A5) are loudest, extremes (A1, A8) barely
audible. Unfreeze: the ascent resumes from wherever it paused.

Switch to **Whole-tone** interval: the illusion takes on a staccato quality — a mechanical clock
ticking upward step by step, each step clearly a whole tone higher, yet the register never
changes. Switch to **Semitone**: the individual pitches are distinct, you can hear each rung of
the staircase. Switch back to **Glide**: the smoothest, most seamless version of the illusion.

Try **Descending**: an endlessly falling tone that never lands. The sensation is qualitatively
different from ascending — more like a drain, or falling without hitting the ground.

For mic mode: click 🎤, then play piano. Loud chords accelerate the ascent. A single quiet note
lets the staircase breathe slowly. The ascent rate reflects the energy of what you're playing —
like the music is driving its own hallucination.

Watch the oscillator column (right side): the glow sweeps upward circle by circle. When A8 (top)
fades dark, a moment later A1 (bottom) begins to glow — you can *see* the wrap in the visual,
even though you can't hear it in the audio.

### 39-anticipate

Open `/dream/39-anticipate`. Click **DEMO** — the 10-note C major phrase begins painting the YOU
(orange) panel one note at a time. After the last note, 2 seconds pass, then: all of Aria's
planned response notes appear simultaneously as dashed blue rectangles in the ARIA panel (bottom),
spread across the right half of the canvas. You can see the whole response — which notes will be
higher or lower, how long each will last — in silence.

Then the first note sounds and its ghost bar flashes bright and fills solid. 470ms later, the
next note sounds and solidifies. Watch the solidification wave sweep left to right through the
ARIA panel. Each solidifying bar starts with a 280ms glow burst (blur 28, glow 1.0) then settles
to normal brightness. The dashed outlines to the right are Aria's "still-ghost" notes: her
intentions not yet executed.

In mic mode: play 8+ notes on piano, pause 2 seconds. Ghost notes appear before Aria speaks.

### 38-mood-xy
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 42 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/38-mood-xy`. Click **▶ Play**. Immediately drag the dot to the top-right corner
(excited+happy) — you'll hear fast bright major arpeggios at ~120 BPM. Drag to top-left
(excited+sad) — the arpeggios darken to diminished runs, the timbre dulls. Drag to bottom-right
(calm+happy) — the rhythm slows to 55 BPM and the chords become simultaneous major pads. Drag
to bottom-left (calm+sad) — 40 BPM, sparse minor chords, almost sub-bass register, minimal.

Watch the background color shift: amber → purple → teal → navy as you traverse the four
quadrants. The white trail shows where you've been. The top-center label names your current
quadrant ("energetic · happy", "calm · sad", etc.) and shows current BPM and chord quality.

Try dragging slowly in a large circle — you can hear all four quadrant characters blend into
each other continuously. The center point (both axes at 0) is the quietest, slowest, most
neutral state: one voice, 70 BPM, minor chord, mid-register, medium sustain.

### 37-ratio-lab
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 41 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/37-ratio-lab`. The 9×5 grid renders immediately (no button press).
Hover any node — tooltip shows pitch class, JI fraction, Hz, cents deviation from 12-TET.

Click the center node (A3, amber, labeled "A") — a sine tone rings at 220 Hz against the drone.
Hear that they're the same note: no beating, locked in. Click the node one step right (E4, "E",
3/2) — you'll hear the perfect fifth. Extremely clean interval; JI P5 is 2¢ sharp of 12-TET P5.
Click the node above the root (C#4, "C♯", 5/4) — the major third. At +14¢ flat of 12-TET M3,
it's noticeably purer. Stack root + fifth + major third: you hear an A major chord in just
intonation — three simultaneously locked sine waves.

Click the +5¢ label on any node to hear the difference from its 12-TET position (the drone IS
the 1/1 root, and the sine tones are exact JI ratios — no piano temperament involved).

For mic mode: click **🎤 Mic**, play a sustained A or E on piano. The nearest node pulses blue.
Play a scale — watch the ring walk across the lattice one node at a time.

Open `/dream/36-pluck-field`. Click any of the 24 cells — you'll hear a plucked string sound
immediately (no button press needed: AudioContext initializes on first click). The bottom row
(C2–C3) has deep, long-sustaining bass strings; the top row (G5–G6) has bright, quickly-decaying
treble strings. Click a chord shape: C4, E4, G4 (three neighboring cells in the middle rows)
for a C major pentatonic chord.

Try a full glissando: click the bottom-left cell (C2) and drag right across the bottom row, then
up to the next row. Low bass strings bloom violet; treble strings glow orange. With multiple
strings ringing simultaneously, the canvas fills with overlapping standing waves.

For mic mode: click **🎤 mic**, allow permissions, clap or play piano with rhythmic attacks.
Each onset plucks a string in the octave range matching your playing's brightness. Bass drum =
plucks low strings (violet); cymbal = plucks high strings (orange).

Note: if many bass strings ring simultaneously, the output can get loud — the master gain is
set to 0.5 but multiple overlapping C2 strings will sum. Turn down speakers/headphones first
when testing chord storms.

Open `/dream/35-loop-station`. Click **▶ Load demo loops** — four pre-synthesized loops render
via OfflineAudioContext and all four start simultaneously on the next bar boundary at 80 BPM.
You hear a sub-bass drone (violet, Slot 1), piano phrase (green, Slot 2), bright arpeggio
(orange, Slot 3), and rhythmic click (yellow, Slot 4) — all locked to the same grid.

Try muting Slot 3 (orange arpeggio) and then unmuting it on the next downbeat. Try **CLEAR** on
the click track, then tap **TAP BPM** on the beat and record a new rhythm with your own voice
into Slot 4: press **● REC**, make some rhythmic sounds, press **■ STOP**. The new loop
joins the grid at the next bar boundary. All four layers play phase-locked.

To record without the demo: click **🎤 Start mic**, wait for "mic live", then press **● REC**

**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 37 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/34-spectral-morph`. Click **▶ Demo (sawtooth → sine)** — both sources start immediately.
Watch the three spectrum strips: Source A (bottom) blazes with harmonics (sawtooth), Source B (top)
has a single tall spike at C3 (sine). The Blend (middle) starts identical to A.

Drag the **MORPH** slider toward B. The harmonics in the Blend strip compress: n=2, 3, 4... fade.
At t=0.5 the blend has half-amplitude harmonics — a timbre between saw and sine. At t=1 only the
fundamental remains. Drag back fast: the harmonics snap back immediately.

For the best demo: select **noise** as Source B before starting. Slide to t=0.5 — you hear a
pitched buzz with noisy harmonics, like a bowed metal edge. Slide to t=1.0 — pure broadband noise.
Slide back to 0 — a clean sawtooth. This cross-dissolve is acoustically real; a crossfade cannot do it.

**Mic mode**: click **🎤 Start mic**, play piano. Source A is your mic input; Source B is the
selected synth. Drag the slider to gradually dissolve your piano into a sine wave of the same pitch
and phase. The Blend spectrum strip shows your playing's harmonic structure as you play it.

itself into the YOU (orange) panel of the piano roll, one note at a time. After the last note,
a 2-second pause, then "Aria is thinking..." appears briefly. The ARIA (blue) panel fills with
Aria's response — a 10-note phrase derived from pentatonic intervals off the demo's last note
(cold Markov table on first run). Each subsequent demo cycle teaches the Markov table and the
responses converge toward your melodic tendencies.

Click **START MIC** and allow permissions. Play 8+ piano notes (any melody), then stop for 2
seconds. Aria responds. Play again — watch the Markov table accumulate. After 3 exchanges of

Open `/dream/32-mood-vis`. Click **Demo** — the canvas begins in "minimal" mode (dim Lissajous
figure, silence simulated). After 5 seconds it transitions to "calm · bright" (ink rings expanding
from center, cool cyan). Watch the mode name update in the top-left as it cycles through all six.
The sidebar mood list highlights the active mode.

Click **Start mic** and play a bass note on piano — classifier should read calm_dark (low centroid,
moderate amplitude) and switch to the violet orbital drift. Switch to bright, high chords —
energetic_bright triggers the radial bloom with warm spokes radiating outward. Hit something
percussive (drum on a table, slap) — the complex classifier fires and the spectral mandala appears.
The HUD shows AMP, CENT (Hz), and SPREAD (CV of band energies) so you can see what's driving each

Try **Stone Chamber**: hear the piano note decay with a long 3.5s stone-room reverb tail.
Percussion hits arrive from directly above (stone on ceiling). The low resonance drone is
positioned behind and below — you feel the weight of the room.

Try **Cosmic Ascension**: the 55/110/220Hz harmonic pads (pure octaves) swell in over 2 seconds

Click or drag on the black grid canvas to paint/erase cells. Try placing a few horizontal rows
of cells at different heights — they'll trigger chords at the same pitch every tick. Mix a
Glider into a running Pulsar grid and watch the Glider gradually disrupt the Pulsar's rhythm.

Click **Acorn** → **Start** for 5206 generations of chaos before it stabilizes.

### 24-piano-roll
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 28 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/24-piano-roll`. Click **Demo mode** — Bach Invention No.1 begins rendering its
own notes immediately. Watch the colored bars scroll left from the cursor line; C-note octave
markers help you read the pitch positions. Try the BPM slider — the bars stretch or compress
proportionally.

Click **Start mic** and play any single-note melody on piano or hum. Each note appears as a
glowing bar at its exact MIDI pitch. The piano key sidebar on the left highlights your current
note. Play a scale and watch the bars step up or down the grid in real time.

### 23-pitch-harmonize
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 26 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-19

Open `/dream/23-pitch-harmonize`. Click **Start mic** and allow permissions. Play a sustained
piano note or sing. Click **+5th** — your harmony appears a perfect fifth above you, floating
to the right in your headphones. Switch intervals live; the pitch shift updates without restart.

Drag the **pos** slider to place the harmony anywhere from hard-left to hard-right. Reduce
**harm** volume to blend dry and harmony. The scope shows two overlapping ellipses: orange =
your dry signal, blue = the shifted harmony. At a fifth interval they tilt at distinctly
different angles — the visual form of the interval.

No permissions for demo? The page will show an error and you'll need mic access. This is the
only prototype that genuinely requires live audio input (no demo oscillator mode — the whole
point is your own playing transformed).

Open `/dream/21-three-mesh-av`. Click **Demo mode** — the icosahedron immediately begins
breathing with 6 LFO-modulated oscillators. Watch the equatorial belt expand and contract
as the low-frequency oscillators pulse; the polar caps shift with the high-frequency ones.
Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom. Bloom halos the brightest displaced vertices.

Click **Start mic** and play piano or sing. Bass notes visually inflate the equatorial ring.
Treble notes elongate the sphere toward its poles. Silence lets you see the organic breathing
of the noise term alone.

### 8-particle-life
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 8 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/8-particle-life`. Click **Start demo** — 900 particles immediately
self-organize into emergent patterns driven by a random 6×6 attraction/repulsion
matrix. No flocking code; no goals; purely emergent. Press **reshuffle** to
randomize the matrix and watch the entire swarm re-organize.

Start mic → play something with clear percussive hits (drums, piano). Loud
onsets reshuffle the matrix automatically. The six species respond to their
corresponding audio bands — sub-bass kicks animate the violet particles, cymbal
shimmer animates the pink ones.

Matrix heatmap in the top-left corner (green=attraction, red=repulsion) shows
the current rules. FPS counter and species energy bars also displayed.

64 log-spaced frequency columns × 80 time-history rows. Painter's algorithm renders back-to-front:
each row's ridge occludes rows behind it. Fake-perspective scale makes the nearest row fill the
bottom of the screen and the oldest row converge at the horizon. Two modes: demo (6 oscillators

### 10-strange
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 10 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/10-strange`. Click **Start demo** — the Lorenz attractor begins tracing
its butterfly immediately, and FM synthesis starts. The carrier pitch flips between
registers as the trajectory switches wings. Watch the z readout rise and fall; you'll
hear the timbre shift from clean to buzzy in sync.

Start mic → play something or sing loud. Your RMS amplitude feeds into σ, accelerating
or decelerating the wing transitions. Loud = chaotic pitch turbulence. Quiet = the
attractor settles into longer wing visits, more sustained tones.

### 9-reaction-diffusion
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 9 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/9-reaction-diffusion`. Click **Start demo** — a Gray-Scott RD simulation
initializes and runs 600 warmup steps before the first frame so the pattern is
already visible. Pick a preset (Coral, Fingerprint, Spots, Stripes, Mitosis, Maze)
to switch pattern families mid-run. Click anywhere on the canvas to inject a new
activation blob and watch a colony grow from scratch.

With mic + music: bass raises feed rate (denser, more energetic patterns); treble
raises kill rate (structures become more isolated). Drum hits auto-inject blobs.

Requires WebGL2 + EXT_color_buffer_float (Chrome 56+, Firefox 51+, Safari 15+).

### 20-scope
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 22 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/20-scope`. Click **Lissajous demo** — no permissions needed. Ratio starts at
1:1 (unison, ellipse) and auto-cycles every 5 seconds through octave, fifth, fourth, sixth,
M3rd, m3rd. Watch each figure build up its CRT glow over 1–2 seconds. Click any ratio button
to jump. The phase slowly oscillates so the figure breathes between open/closed states.

Click **Phase portrait** and allow mic. Play a sustained piano note — you'll see an ellipse
with overtone loops decorating it. Play a chord — multiple loops overlap. Use the delay slider
to find the delay that gives the cleanest ellipse for the note you're playing (quarter-period
of the fundamental). Play staccato — the figure appears on the attack then fades.

### 19-cymatics
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 21 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/19-cymatics`. Click **Start demo** — particles scatter from the canvas center
and gradually resolve into the (1,2) Ring pattern (two diagonal node lines + an ellipse).
Watch the modes cycle every 4.5 seconds: Clover, Cross, Asterisk, Lattice, Fine Star,
Crystal, Snowflake — each pattern distinct, more intricate than the last. The transition
(scatter → resolve) takes 2–4 seconds per mode.

Click **Start mic** and play a sustained piano note. The spectral centroid maps to the
nearest mode; hold a bass note for the simpler modes, play high treble for the complex ones.
Manual mode buttons override at any time.

### 18-granular
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 20 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/18-granular`. Click **Start demo** — five LFO-modulated sine oscillators feed the
analyser silently and grains immediately begin spawning. Each dot that appears is a real grain of
audio playing through your speakers; X is where in the recent buffer it was sampled, Y is its
pitch shift. Watch the cloud breathe as the LFO mix slowly shifts.

Click **Start mic** and play piano or sing. A sustained note creates a vertical stripe (all grains
near the same buffer position, random pitch smear). A chord thickens the stripe. Staccato notes
make the cloud pulse and fade between attacks. Try: density=40, pitch=800¢ for a lush alien reverb.

Four sliders live-adjustable while running: density (grains/sec), pitch range (¢), grain size (ms),
scatter (how far from recent audio grains are allowed to sample).

### 17-acoustic-trail
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 19 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/17-acoustic-trail`. Click **Start demo** — six oscillators with independent LFOs
begin tracing a slow path through the acoustic feature space. The point cloud grows and the
trail curves as dominant frequencies shift. Drag to rotate the 3D view and see the path from
different angles.

Click **Start mic** and play anything — piano, voice, or drums. Single pitches trace vertical
columns; rich chords spread into clouds; bass notes pull the trail toward the Z wall; treble
content lifts it up the Y axis. The `clear` button resets the trail without stopping audio.

### 16-particle-life-gpu
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 17 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-18

Open `/dream/16-particle-life-gpu`. Click **Start demo** — 9,000 particles immediately
self-organize into emergent patterns driven by a random 6×6 matrix, simulated on GPU via
WGSL compute. Compare with `/dream/8-particle-life` (CPU, 900 particles) to see the
density difference. Press **reshuffle** for a new emergent pattern. With mic: loud onsets
reshuffle automatically; band energies drive per-species turbulence.

Open `/dream/14-typography`. Click **Start demo** — letters immediately scatter in from
random positions and spring-assemble into RESONANCE. Watch the phrase cycle every 8 seconds.
Each letter belongs to one frequency band; the LFO-driven demo bands keep letters in gentle
perpetual motion even between beats.

Click **Start mic** and play anything with rhythmic content. Bass hits scatter the violet/cyan
letters; drum attacks burst all letters radially outward. Between hits, the spring pulls them
back into the phrase. Long phrases (SOUND INTO LIGHT) become abstract particle clouds on loud
passages; short phrases (FREQUENCIES) read clearly even at high energy.

Open `/dream/13-piano-canvas`. Click **Demo mode** — a wandering piano melody plays silently
and the canvas begins painting itself. Each note leaves a glowing brush stroke; pitch sets the
hue (bass notes = cool blues/greens, treble = warm oranges/reds), loudness sets the weight,
duration sets the length. The stroke cursor drifts up for rising melodic lines and down for
descending ones.

Click **Start mic** and play piano, sing, or hum. Your improvisation accumulates as a painting.

appears instantly. Watch the curves: they connect across the full canvas, then
rewire on each beat. Click **reshuffle** to reset the topology with a full-grid
flash. **Start mic** → play something with clear bass hits; the rewire mass-flip
fires on each onset.

Two complementary-colored arc families (primary hue + 165° offset) slowly rotate
through the spectrum over 40 seconds. With mids loud, saturation peaks and the
colors pop; with quiet audio, the arcs dim to near-black.

Open `/dream/210-aria-companion`. Click **Start mic** and play piano (or sing a melody). After you pause for 1.5 seconds, Aria responds with an 8-note phrase built from a Markov chain of your own note transitions. Your phrase appears as warm orange bars on the top piano roll; Aria's response as cool blue bars below. The Markov table accumulates across rounds — the longer you play, the more Aria mirrors your melodic style. No mic? Click anyway: a demo pentatonic phrase seeds the chain and Aria responds automatically.

### 215-fm-explorer
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 249 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-30

Open `/dream/215-fm-explorer`. Click **Start FM** and move your cursor across the canvas. X = carrier pitch (C2–C7), Y = modulator ratio (0.5–8×). Moving left-to-right transposes the tone across five octaves; moving top-to-bottom sweeps from complex metallic textures (high ratio) to pure harmonic tones (low ratio near 1:1). The FM index slider controls modulation depth — at 0 you hear a pure sine everywhere; at 15 the canvas becomes a noise-to-bell landscape. Preset buttons jump to Bell (E4, ratio √2), Rhodes (C3, ratio 2:1), Clangy (G3, ratio 3.5:1), Sub (A1, ratio 1:1), Metallic (D3, ratio 5:3). Mic mode routes your RMS amplitude to the index — play louder for more metallic edge.

## How to use this sandbox

- **Don't expect production polish**. These are dreams. Some will be
  beautiful, some will be broken, all are exploratory.
- **You're in the loop.** Open a Claude Code conversation, say "what
  did you dream last night?" The assistant will summarize and propose
  directions. Tell it what to deepen / kill / add.
- **Adding ideas**: tell Claude "add this to the dream queue: ..." and
  it'll write into IDEAS.md. Next agent cycle picks it up.
- **Stopping the loop**: go to claude.ai/code/routines, disable
  "Resonance Dream Agent." Re-enable any time.

**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 252 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-30

Open `/dream/218-kids-xylophone-drops`. Five glowing bars sit at the bottom in a staircase — the tallest bar (violet) plays the deepest note; the shortest (rose) the highest. Drops fall every 1.8 seconds from the top, each aimed at a random bar. Watch them fall and hear them ring. Tap the sky above any column to spawn a drop there; tap directly on a bar to ring it instantly. All bars are C major pentatonic — every drop harmonizes.

Open `/dream/220-kids-fireworks`. Tap anywhere in the dark star-filled sky to launch a glowing rocket toward that spot. The rocket arcs upward over 0.75 seconds — watch it climb — then explodes into 22 glowing sparks falling with gravity, and a pentatonic chord rings out. Left side = violet = C4 (deep); right side = cyan = C5 (bright); three more colors/pitches in between. All five notes are C major pentatonic — every explosion harmonizes. Three rockets auto-launch on load so the canvas is never silent.

### 229-chord-canvas
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 263 · **Last touched**: 2026-05-31

Open `/dream/229-chord-canvas`. Play any chord on piano or guitar and watch the detector name it: "Dm", "Gmaj", "F♯m". The chord name fills the top of the screen in large monospace type, colored by root note (C = red, D = yellow, A = violet — same chromatic hue wheel as `1-live`). A timeline strip scrolls left at the bottom: each chord you play becomes a colored block, width = duration. A 12-bin chromagram shows live pitch-class energy. **Try demo mode first** (ii–V–I: Dm → G → C plays automatically). Then switch to mic and play your own chords.

Detection: 4096-point FFT → 12-bin chroma → dot-product match against 24 major/minor templates. No ML, no server, no API. First music-theory prototype in the sandbox — 228 prior builds visualized audio signal properties; this one names the musical structure.

### 236-particle-life-song
**Status**: `demoable` · **Cycle shipped**: 269 · **Last touched**: 2026-06-01

Open `/dream/236-particle-life-song`. Press **Start** and watch ~2,400 particles in five colored species self-organize into living cells, chasers, and membranes — driven by an asymmetric attraction matrix where (say) rose chases emerald while emerald flees rose. The twist: each species owns a pentatonic voice that **blooms louder and brighter as its swarm condenses** and fades as it disperses, so you are literally hearing the system find its own structure. Hit **New world** to reseed the matrix and hunt for regimes that sing; drag to stir. Music FROM emergence, not music visualized.

Tech: classic Particle Life (Ventrella's *Clusters* / CodeParade) — CPU sim with a toroidal spatial-hash grid (O(N) neighbors), rendered as additive WebGL `THREE.Points`. Each frame an exact per-species clustering metric (avg same-species neighbors) is EMA-smoothed and mapped to each voice's gain + filter cutoff.

Open `/dream/238-kids-tilt-world`. **For kids (4+).** Tap **Tilt to play**, then *lean the iPad* — a glowing marble rolls across a warm, undulating 3D hill-world (three.js `PerspectiveCamera` over a sine-bump heightfield) in whatever direction you tilt, with real downhill gravity along the surface so valleys and hills steer the ball. Roll it onto the five glowing colored pads scattered over the hills → each rings a soft bell (C-major pentatonic, BANDIMAL: bigger pad = lower pitch) and bursts into sparkles. The note pans left/right via a `StereoPannerNode` driven by the marble's on-screen x, so the sound follows the ball across the world. A soft detuned-sine drone fades in on first gesture so it's never silent; the marble leaves a glowing trail and the camera gently follows it.

No reading, no tapping the screen, no score, no "wrong" note — the instrument is the child's own body leaning the tablet. Degrades gracefully: iOS motion permission is requested behind the Start button; on denial / no sensor / no tilt events within ~1.8s it auto-switches to a pointer-drag fallback (drag the marble) with a readable rose note, and there's an explicit "No tilt? Drag to play" button. First tilt-controlled 3D kids piece in the lab (all ~110 others are touch + 2D canvas); first kids piece with spatial panned audio tied to ball position. Reference: *Inertia* (kikkupico WebGL accelerometer marble, 2026) + LocoRoco/tilt-labyrinth lineage; embodied music cognition.

Open `/dream/243-spectral-cloud`. Press **Start** (a generative C-major-pentatonic ambient pad plays immediately) or **Drop a track** — ideally one of your own piano recordings — and your music becomes a slowly-rotating **volumetric nebula of light you orbit**. Each frame of the spectrum is deposited into 3D space: angle/radius around a disk = frequency (bass in the core, highs at the rim), height = time (a stack of 96 ring-buffered disks = a rolling few-second memory), point size + brightness = energy, hue = frequency (violet→cyan→rose). Drag to orbit, scroll to dolly, auto-orbit resumes when you let go.

Three subsystems beyond the deposition: an **energy-flux onset detector** fires an expanding spherical **shockwave shell** + a camera dolly-punch + a bloom pulse, with a live onset light + BPM estimate; the **spectral centroid** biases global hue and the cloud's dispersion (bright music blooms wider/sparklier, dark music condenses) so the *shape* tracks timbre, not just loudness; and a **dual audio source** (always-alive generative pad + `decodeAudioData` file loop through one analyser). Rendered as a single `THREE.Points` cloud with a custom GLSL `ShaderMaterial` (per-point size + additive bloom) — the lab's first volumetric orbital point-cloud of spectral history. References: Refik Anadol *Machine Hallucinations* data-sculptures + Ryoji Ikeda *data.scan*.

Zero new deps · zero API.
