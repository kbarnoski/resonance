# Resonance Dream IDEAS — living queue

Each idea has a status (`queued` / `in-progress` / `demoable` / `polished` / `dead`),
a slug (becomes the route `/dream/<n>-<slug>`), and a spec terse enough for
the Dream Agent to build from. Add new ideas to the bottom; promote
items by editing status in place.

The agent appends new ideas here from research cycles. Karel adds ideas
via Claude Code conversation; assistant transcribes into this file.

## SEEDED — to build first

### 1. live — mic-input audio-reactive viz `[in-progress]`

**Question**: what if Resonance could respond to anything you play, live?

**Spec**:
- Route: `/dream/1-live`
- "Start mic" button → `getUserMedia({ audio: true })` → Web Audio AnalyserNode
- Split FFT into 6 bands: sub-bass (20-60Hz), bass (60-250), low-mid (250-500), mid (500-2k), high-mid (2k-4k), high (4k-20k)
- Map energy per band to color/intensity using:
  - sub-bass → deep violet/indigo (cool, heavy)
  - bass → cyan/teal (cool, fluid)
  - low-mid → green (transitional)
  - mid → yellow (warming)
  - high-mid → orange (warm, sharp)
  - high → red/magenta (hottest, finest detail)
- Canvas viz: full-screen, six radial color fields blooming from center, each band controlling one. Smooth interpolation (exponential moving average per band) so it breathes, not flickers.
- Onset detector → trigger a brief white flash for percussive hits
- Tempo estimate → BPM display in corner
- Sensitivity slider (live performance needs tunable mic gain)
- Latency target: <50ms input-to-screen

**Why this first**: it's the most-discoverable prototype (anyone with a mic can play), demonstrates the band→color mapping that informs all other prototypes, and proves the live-input pipeline works.

### 2. ghost-lab — A/B Ghost LoRA testing `[queued]`

**Question**: can we iterate the Ghost LoRA faster by comparing variants side-by-side?

**Spec**:
- Route: `/dream/2-ghost-lab`
- UI: prompt textarea, LoRA scale slider (0.5–1.5), seed input, "Generate A vs B" button
- Generates two images via `/api/ai-image/generate` with different scales OR different prompts
- Side-by-side display with vote buttons (👍 A, 👍 B, both, neither)
- Stores votes to localStorage to build intuition for what scales work for what scenes
- Pre-set "scenes" dropdown: "stone chamber back-view", "forest dawn full-body", "cosmic flying profile" — quick way to test the LoRA on key Ghost compositions without rewriting prompts
- Admin-only (reuses existing `isAdmin` gate)

**Why**: the LoRA tuning right now is "play Ghost, watch, guess what's wrong, change a number." This makes it deliberate.

### 3. fluid — Navier-Stokes fluid driven by audio `[queued]`

**Question**: what if the visualizer felt like ink in water reacting to sound?

**Spec**:
- Route: `/dream/3-fluid`
- GPU fluid simulation (port a small open-source shader-based solver — e.g. Pavel Dobryakov's WebGL fluid sim or a leaner variant)
- Mic input (reuse `/dream/1-live`'s analyser hook from `_shared/`)
- Audio mapping:
  - Bass energy → pressure pulses at center
  - Treble energy → curl/turbulence forces
  - Spectral centroid → injection color (low pitch = blue, high pitch = red)
  - Onset → splat at random position
- Touch/mouse stir as fallback when no mic
- Toggle: "react to mic" / "ambient drift"

**Why**: pure GPU, very different aesthetic from existing Resonance shaders, performs well on lower-end devices, captivating to interact with.

### 4. operator — Tauri-mode operator panel mock `[queued]`

**Question**: what does running Resonance from a venue's booth look like?

**Spec**:
- Route: `/dream/4-operator`
- Two-pane UI: left = "performer view" (large viz preview + scene list), right = "operator controls" (scene picker, MIDI map, transition timer, fader for mic-input gain, BPM tap)
- Scene library: 6 pre-baked scenes (each is one of the dream prototypes or a Resonance journey snapshot), pickable, transitions with crossfade
- MIDI input (Web MIDI API): when a MIDI device is connected, show "MIDI: <device name>" and let user assign CC knobs to scene-blend fader / scene-trigger pads
- BPM tap button (spacebar) → drives any scene's pulse params
- Crowd-noise meter (mic input) — visual indicator only for now; later could trigger climax cues

**Why**: live performance is the highest-impact future for Resonance. Even a mock helps you (Karel) think through what controls a performer needs.

### 5. arcs — Journey engine v2 (non-psychedelic arcs) `[queued]`

**Question**: what if journeys could have shapes other than the 6-phase psychedelic arc?

**Spec**:
- Route: `/dream/5-arcs`
- Arc picker: "Psychedelic (current)" / "EDM Build-and-Drop" / "Cinematic Three-Act" / "Ritual / Ceremony" / "Sleep Cycle"
- Each arc is its own phase definition (count, duration weights, shader rotation rules, post-fx curves, ambient layers)
- Audio source: looped sample (provide a short audio file in `public/dream/` per arc that matches the arc's shape, or use mic input)
- Visual demo of how each arc unfolds: timeline at bottom, phase chips light up, color/shader changes mid-arc
- Side panel: "what's different about this arc": text comparing it to the psychedelic baseline

**Why**: forces an explicit articulation of what "a Resonance journey" actually IS structurally, opens the door to non-introspective use cases (dance music, soundtracks, ambient sleep, ritual ceremonies).

## QUEUED — agent may pick up after seeded set

### strange — strange attractor viz `[queued]`
Lorenz / Aizawa / Thomas attractors rendered in 3D, parameters modulated by audio. Bass adjusts σ/ρ/β; treble adjusts time-step. Webgl + instanced points or lines.

### tessellate — Penrose / Truchet tile rhythm `[queued]`
Aperiodic tiling that re-tiles on beat. Each beat: ~10% of tiles flip. Mid-frequency density controls color saturation. Aesthetic: op-art.

### terrain — fly-through spectrogram `[queued]`
Last 60s of FFT history is a 3D terrain. Camera flies forward through it. Bass = mountain height, treble = surface detail. Like Audiosurf for any audio.

### typography — generative kinetic type `[queued]`
Live poetry from existing Resonance poetry system → animated 3D type that breaks/forms with music. Variable font weight modulated by amplitude.

### reaction-diffusion — Turing patterns alive `[queued]`
Gray-Scott RD simulation. Audio drives feed/kill rates. Patterns evolve like coral/leopard spots/stripes. Hypnotic.

### audience — multi-phone collective viz `[queued]`
WebRTC channel: multiple phones in a venue each contribute one color/shape, server (or peer mesh) composites into one shared visualizer. Tech-heavy; might require backend work outside the dream zone — flag for design discussion first.
